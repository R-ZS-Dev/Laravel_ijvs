Metabolic disorders occur when the body&#39;s normal metabolic process is disrupted by abnormal chemical reactions. It can also be characterized as a hereditary single gene aberration, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (Zheng et al. 2021). Physical inactivity, cigarette smoking and an elevated BMI are all lifestyle risk factors. Other causes include hypertension, poor glucose metabolism and high blood pressure and cholesterol concentration contribute to these disorders (Akhuemonkhan and Lazo 2017). Lethargy, weight loss, jaundice, and seizures are some of the signs of metabolic diseases. Symptoms would differ depending on the type of metabolic disease. Acute symptoms, late-onset acute symptoms, gradual general symptoms, and persistent symptoms are the four types of symptoms (Agana et al. 2018; Mendrick et al. 2018). Inherited metabolic diseases are a type of metabolic disorder caused by a faulty gene that results in an enzyme deficit. Inborn errors of metabolism are a group of disorders with a variety of subtypes. When the liver or pancreas does not function properly, metabolic disorders might develop. Fig. 1 represented some types of metabolic disorders (Hern&aacute;ndez-Granados et al. 2018). Any sickness or disorder that affects the human reproductive system is referred to as reproductive disorders. Improper hormone yielding via ovaries or testes, as well as other endocrine glands is among them . Genetic or congenital defects, infections, tumors, or disorders of unknown sources can all cause these diseases (Hutson et al. 2014) . Genetic abnormalities, genital anomalies, infections, structural differences, and cancers are the primary divisions of these disorders (Rawal and Austin 2015; Elshazly et al. 2019). Symptoms of reproductive disorders are bleeding in between periods and within it, itching, burning of the genital area, and pain during sex, severe pelvic/abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination (Hutson et al. 2014). Common reproductive conditions for human females are anomalies of the clitoris, vagina and uterus, abnormalities of menstrual cycle endometriosis, cancers, polycystic ovarian syndrome and diseases as AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital herpes. And in men are pseudo hermaphroditism, anomalies of the penis, urethra, testes, prostate gland and seminal vesicles, Impotence, benign prostatic hyperplasia, Priapism, testicular cancer and prostate disease. Intersexuality syndrome as Klinefelter, Turner, and testicular feminization. Delayed and precocious puberty in both (Rawal and Austin 2015). Infertility is one of the most serious issues that is worsening by the day and endangering the human generation&#39;s future. Varicocele reduces sperm morphology and improves sperm count in people with aberrant morphology. Ovarian, cervical and prostate cancers are the deadliest of reproductive cancers. Some risk factors for this malignancy include age, history of family and late menopause. While pregnant and breastfeeding, the likelihood of occurrence is reduced (Salehi et al. 2008). There is a relation between metabolic and reproductive disorders as diabetic complications can lead to some reproductive disorder as subfertility, delayed puberty or disturbance in the menstrual cycle. Reproductive difficulties can appear early in adolescence, later, or during the climacteric period, relying on the age at which diabetes is discovered. Decreased concentrations of LH, FSH and estradiol occurred in type 2 human studies (Gnanadass et al. 2021). Because of central hypogonadism, women with type 1 diabetes sometimes have amenorrhoea, polycystic ovarian syndrome and hyperandrogenism, and infertility that can be controlled by insulin administration and improved metabolic disorder (Codner et al. 2012). Also, type 2 diabetes is related to other reproductive disorders like obesity and insulin resistance related to polycystic ovarian syndrome due to improper lifestyle. Although pubertal breast development appears to be delayed in type 1 diabetes, some people with type 1 diabetes still experience a small delay in menarche due to diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy (Calcaterra et al. 2021). The most common menstrual cycle abnormalities are oligomenorrhoea and prolonged cycle length that are related to patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, studies revealed that these disturbances are more than six times than normal women without diabetes. Disturbance in BMI, sex steroid and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations is also related to type 2 diabetes (Thong et al. 2021).</p>\r\n', '<p>TTStudy E<strong>thical Approval The auth</strong>ors confirm that the ethical policies of the journal have been adhered to and the appropriate ethical review committee approval has been received. The authors followed EU standards for the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. The experimental work was conducted at Sakha Research Station in Kafrelsheikh Governorate, Animal Production Research Institute, Agricultural Research Center, the Ministry of Agriculture, Egypt. The laboratory part conducted at laboratories of National Research Centre, Animal Production Department, Egypt, and By-Products Research Department, Animal Production Research Institute, Agricultural Research Center, Egypt. Extracts of Olive Leaves and Olive Pomace Olive leaves and pomace were extracted using 65 percent ethanol with vigorous stirring for three hours adopting a heat reflux extraction procedure. The extract was then separated at 40&deg;C using a rotary evaporator (Loghmanifar et al. 2020; Elsherif et al. 2021). Finally, Calcium carbonate was added as a carrier material to load the extracts separately, giving them the ability to use and mix with feed ingredients. Experimental Diets According to Agriculture Ministry Decree, 1996 requirements, the control diet was formed to meet all the nutritional needs of growing rabbits. Control (without additives), OLE1 (Olive leaves extract, 200ppm), OLE2 (olive leaves extract, 400ppm), OPE1 (olive pomace extract, 200ppm) and OPE2 (olive pomace extract, 400ppm) were the five treatments. The experiment lasted 56 days (from 42-98 days of age). Table 1 shows the composition of the control diet as well as the computed analyses. Animals and Management Seventy-five APRI growing rabbits were divided into five groups of 15 rabbits each at 42 days of age (624g average body weight). Rabbits were kept in battery cages with separate feeding units. Water and diets were available ad libitum. All the rabbits were kept in the same sanitary and managerial settings. Weekly feed intake and live body weight were recorded and the feed efficiency and body weight gained were computed. Digestibility Trail At the end of this experiment, seven rabbits from each group were used in a digestibility test. Feces were collected daily, weighed, dried at 60&deg;C for 24 hours, roughly powdered, and stored for AOAC, 2000 chemical analysis. According to P&eacute;rez et al. (1995), the coefficients of digestion and nutritional values of the dietary treatments were calculated using data from amounts and chemical analyses of feed and feces. Carcass Characteristics and Blood Samples Five rabbits from each treatment were starved for 24 hours and slaughtered for carcass and internal organs at the end of the experiment. The percentages of carcass and organs as a percentage of live weights were calculated. Blood samples were taken from the slaughtered rabbits as well. Analyses of Antioxidants Status Blood serum samples were separated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, then stored at -20&deg;C until chemical analysis. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in blood serum were examined. The livers were also obtained for the measurement of hepatic CAT, SOD, and GSH antioxidant enzymes in an automated calibration spectrophotometer with high-performance readings (bio diagnostic, Cairo, Egypt) (FlexorEL200 Biochemical Analyzer). Thyroid Hormone Concentration Total T3 and T4 levels in the blood were measured using commercial ELISA kits (MyBioSource, Inc., San Diego, CA). By dividing the T3 value by the T4 value, the T3/T4 ratio was computed. Cecum pH, Ammonia Nitrogen Concentration and Total Volatile Fatty Acids Cecum contents samples were taken from slaughtered rabbits and utilized to measure cecum pH using a digital pH meter immediately. Conway (1958) technique was used to determine the ammonia nitrogen concentration. According to Eadie et al. (1967), the total volatile fatty acids in caecum were determined using steam distillation unit. Economic Efficiency At the end of the trial period, the economic efficiency profit of rabbit production were calculated using the following formula: ➢ (Total feed cost + additives cost) Equals total cost per rabbit. ➢ (Body weight gain (kg) x selling price of kg rabbit) Equals total return per rabbit (Egyptian pound, L.E). ➢ Total return per rabbit - total cost per rabbit equals net return per rabbit (L.E.). ➢ Net return per rabbit divided by total cost per rabbit equals economic efficiency (L.E.). ➢ Economic efficiency of each treatment calculated for each one with multiplying by 100 (control economic efficiency).</p>\r\n', '<p><s><strong>Performance Parameters Table 2 shows t</strong></s>he effects of olive leaves and pomace extracts on body weight (bwt), weight gain (WG), feed intake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in growing rabbits. The results revealed that adding 200ppm (OLE1, OPE1) or 400ppm (OLE2, OPE2) of olive leaves extract or olive pomace extract raised the final bwt linearly (P&lt;0.05). In comparison to the control diet, which had a final body weight of 2011g, OPE1 had the highest value (2175g). There were no significant variations in bwt between the groups given OLE or OPE at the two levels tested. The addition of OLE or OPE greatly improved WG at all ages, and the results of WG followed the same trend as bwt. OPE had a better effect on WG than OLE, although there were no significant differences between them. The feed intake of rabbits fed varied amounts of OLE or OPE in their diets was unaffected linearly (P&lt;0.05). In terms of FCR, adding OLE or OPE to growing rabbit diets enhanced FCR linearly (P&lt;0.05) during the period of the trial compared to the control group. The addition of OPE improved FCR more than the addition of OLE. At the overall ages of the rabbits, the results of the performance index (PI percent) and relative growth rate (RGR percent) demonstrated significant (P&lt;0.05) differences across the dietary treatments. In comparison to the control, adding OLE or OPE to the rabbits&#39; diets enhanced PI and RGR considerably. The rabbits fed on OPE1-enriched diet had the highest PI and RGR with values 69.31 and 113.12, respectively. In terms of PI and RGR, there were no significant changes between OLE and OPE. Digestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values Table 3 shows the effect of olive leaves and pomace extracts on the digestibility coefficients and nutritional values of growing rabbits. The addition of OLE or OPE had no effect on the digestibility coefficients of CF, EE, or NFE. The addition of OLE or OPE raised the digestibility coefficient of CP substantially (P&lt;0.05). The groups fed OLE2 and OPE2 had the best digestibility coefficients for DM, OM and CP. When compared to the control, the addition of OLE or OPE significantly (P&lt;0.05) enhanced total digestible nutrients (TDN), digestible energy (DE), and digestible crude protein (DCP). Carcass Characteristics Table 4 shows the effects of dietary treatments on carcass traits. The addition of OLE or OLP enhanced significantly (P&lt;0.05) carcass percent. The groups supplemented with OLE2 or OPE2 had the highest carcass percent. The proportion of live body weight of the liver, heart, kidney, giblets, and spleen did not change because of the varied additions. The control group had the greatest GIT percent, and dietary treatments supplementation with different levels of extracts significantly (P&lt;0.05) reduced GIT weight as a proportion of live body weight. Antioxidant Status Table 5 shows the effects of dietary treatments on rabbit antioxidant enzymes. When compared to the control group, the addition of olive leaves extract or olive pomace extract at 200 and 400ppm significantly improved total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). MDA, on the other hand, was considerably (P&lt;0.05) reduced when OLE or OPE were added. Thyroid Hormones The results of thyroid hormones were found in growing rabbits, as shown in Fig. 1. The addition of olive leaves extract or olive pomace extract to growing rabbit diets at 200 or 400 ppm had no effect on T3, T4, or T4/T3 in any of the groups. Caecum Fermentation Activities Fig. 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and olive pomace extracts on caecum total volatile fatty acids (TVFAs), ammonia nitrogen and pH. The addition of OLE or OPE had a significant (P&lt;0.05) influence on caecum TVFAs and ammonia concentrations. The TVFA values for the treatment groups varied from 4.16 to 4.14 (ml eq/100mL) compared to 3.85 for the control group. Treatment ammonia concentrations were from 8.49 to 8.32 mg/100mL, compared to 9.76mg/100 ml for the control. The pH levels were unaffected and varied from 5.80 to 5.57 for the treatment groups compared to 5.97 for the control group. Economic Efficiency Table 6 shows the impact of dietary treatments on economic efficiency (EE) and relative economic efficiency (REE). The results showed that adding OLE or OPE to the diet of rabbits improved their relative economic efficiency (REE) compared to the control group. When compared to the control diet, REE levels increased by 13.56 and 18.64 percent with OLE1 and OLE2, and by 25.42 and 19.49 percent with OPE1 and OPE2 for rabbit diets, respectively.</p>\r\n', '<blockquote>\r\n<h2><em>Performance Parameters Results</em> finding are confirmed by Oke et al. (2017), who detected that supplementing olive leaves extract in the drinking water of broiler chicks enhanced final body weight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio linearly (P&lt;0.05). The induction of antimicrobial activity with olive leaves extract components may be linked to growth performance improvements of broilers fed with OLE in drinking water (10mL/L) (Jabri et al. 2017). Furthermore, the enhanced performance rate of rabbits given olive leaves extract might be attributable to the antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral characteristics of olive leaves extract (Aliabadi et al. 2012). According to Shafey et al. (2013), adding olive leaves extract (0, 1.8, 3.6, and 6.25g/kg) to broiler diets had no effect on feed consumption. According to Bahsi et al. (2016), adding 400 ppm of oleuropein to Japanese quail meal boosted feed conversion ratio considerably. Ahmed et al. (2017) found that feeding laying hens 50, 100, or 150mg of oleuropein/kg diet enhanced egg production, egg mass, and feed conversion ratio considerably. H&eacute;la et al. (2019) found that adding olive leaves aqueous extract to the drinking water of developing rabbits at a concentration of 20ml/L boosted daily body weight growth and feed conversion ratio linearly (P&lt;0.05). The inclusion of 750 ppm of an olive pomace extract containing 10% total triterpenes and 2% polyphenols considerably increased broiler chick development performance (Herrero-Encinas et al 2020). When OLE (75, 150, 300 and 600mg/kg) was added to broiler chicken diets, body weight gain, carcass weight, and feed conversion ratio were improved (P&lt;0.05) linearly (Erener et al. 2020). The results of current study found that enhanced growth performance in rabbits given OLE or OPE might be linked to FCR, digestive enzyme activity, and nutrient absorption improvement, as well as controlling the gut microbiota, these findings also agreed with the findings of Zeng et al. (2015). Digestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values The inclusion of OLE2 and OPE2 resulted in the greatest improvement in TDN, DCP, and DE percent. In terms of TDN, DCP, and DE percent, there were no significance differences between OLE1 and control. Broiler diets which contain olive leaves extracts, enhancing growth performance and feed efficiency due to the improvement in nutritional digestibility, digestive enzyme activation, and intestinal morphology (Leskovec et al. 2018). This improvement might be attributed to a decrease in digesta viscosity, which boosts nutrient and enzyme diffusion rates, allowing the animal to digest and absorb more nutrients, resulting in improved intestinal health (Morrison et al. 2017). Furthermore, phenolic compounds in olive leaves can act as antioxidants and antibacterial, resulting in the growth of beneficial microflora and the degradation of harmful or pathogenic microflora in the digestive tract and caecum, resulting in improved nutrient digestibility (Korukluoglu et al. 2010; Hamad 2015; Sarica and &Uuml;rkmez 2016; Thielmann et al. 2017; Elsherif et al. 2021).</h2>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n', 'TTThese results suggested that including 200 and\r\n400ppm of olive leaves or olive pomace extracts into the\r\ndiet of growing rabbits might increase growth, carcass\r\ncharacteristics, antioxidant status, and economic efficiency\r\nwithout any negative effect on their health', 'TTAll authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'TTAll authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', '<div style=\"background:#eeeeee; border:1px solid #cccccc; padding:5px 10px\">Abaza L, Taamalli A, Nsir H and Zarrouk M, 2015.

Metabolic disorders occur when the body\'s normal metabolic process is disrupted by abnormal chemical reactions. It can also be characterized as a hereditary single gene aberration, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (Zheng et al. 2021). Physical inactivity, cigarette smoking and an elevated BMI are all\r\nlifestyle risk factors. Other causes include hypertension, poor glucose metabolism and high blood pressure and\r\ncholesterol concentration contribute to these disorders (Akhuemonkhan and Lazo 2017). Lethargy, weight loss, jaundice, and seizures are some of the signs of metabolic diseases. Symptoms would differ depending on the type of metabolic disease. Acute symptoms, late-onset acute\r\nsymptoms, gradual general symptoms, and persistent symptoms are the four types of symptoms (Agana et al. 2018; Mendrick et al. 2018). Inherited metabolic diseases\r\nare a type of metabolic disorder caused by a faulty gene that results in an enzyme deficit. Inborn errors of metabolism are a group of disorders with a variety of subtypes. When the liver or pancreas does not function properly, metabolic disorders might develop. Fig. 1 represented some types of metabolic disorders (Hernández-Granados et al. 2018). Any sickness or disorder that affects the human reproductive system is referred to as reproductive disorders.\r\nImproper hormone yielding via ovaries or testes, as well as other endocrine glands is among them . Genetic or congenital\r\ndefects, infections, tumors, or disorders of unknown sources can all cause these diseases (Hutson et al. 2014) .\r\nGenetic abnormalities, genital anomalies, infections,\r\nstructural differences, and cancers are the primary divisions of these disorders (Rawal and Austin 2015; Elshazly et al.\r\n2019). Symptoms of reproductive disorders are bleeding in between periods and within it, itching, burning of the\r\ngenital area, and pain during sex, severe pelvic/abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination (Hutson et\r\nal. 2014). Common reproductive conditions for human females are anomalies of the clitoris, vagina and uterus,\r\nabnormalities of menstrual cycle endometriosis, cancers, polycystic ovarian syndrome and diseases as AIDS,\r\nsyphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital herpes. And in men are pseudo hermaphroditism, anomalies of the penis,\r\nurethra, testes, prostate gland and seminal vesicles, Impotence, benign prostatic hyperplasia, Priapism,\r\ntesticular cancer and prostate disease. Intersexuality syndrome as Klinefelter, Turner, and testicular feminization. Delayed and precocious puberty in both\r\n(Rawal and Austin 2015). Infertility is one of the most serious issues that is worsening by the day and endangering\r\nthe human generation\'s future. Varicocele reduces sperm morphology and improves sperm count in people with aberrant morphology. Ovarian, cervical and prostate cancers are the deadliest of reproductive cancers. Some risk\r\nfactors for this malignancy include age, history of family and late menopause. While pregnant and breastfeeding, the\r\nlikelihood of occurrence is reduced (Salehi et al. 2008). There is a relation between metabolic and reproductive\r\ndisorders as diabetic complications can lead to some reproductive disorder as subfertility, delayed puberty or\r\ndisturbance in the menstrual cycle. Reproductive difficulties can appear early in adolescence, later, or during\r\nthe climacteric period, relying on the age at which diabetes is discovered. Decreased concentrations of LH, FSH and\r\nestradiol occurred in type 2 human studies (Gnanadass et al. 2021).\r\nBecause of central hypogonadism, women with type 1 diabetes sometimes have amenorrhoea, polycystic ovarian\r\nsyndrome and hyperandrogenism, and infertility that can be controlled by insulin administration and improved\r\nmetabolic disorder (Codner et al. 2012). Also, type 2 diabetes is related to other reproductive disorders like obesity and insulin resistance related to polycystic ovarian syndrome due to improper lifestyle. Although pubertal breast development appears to be delayed in type 1 diabetes, some people with type 1 diabetes still experience a small delay in menarche due to diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy (Calcaterra et al. 2021). The most common menstrual cycle abnormalities are oligomenorrhoea and\r\nprolonged cycle length that are related to patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, studies revealed that these disturbances\r\nare more than six times than normal women without diabetes. Disturbance in BMI, sex steroid and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations is also related to\r\ntype 2 diabetes (Thong et al. 2021).', 'Study Ethical Approval\r\nThe authors confirm that the ethical policies of the\r\njournal have been adhered to and the appropriate ethical\r\nreview committee approval has been received. The authors\r\nfollowed EU standards for the protection of animals used\r\nfor scientific purposes. The experimental work was\r\nconducted at Sakha Research Station in Kafrelsheikh\r\nGovernorate, Animal Production Research Institute,\r\nAgricultural Research Center, the Ministry of Agriculture,\r\nEgypt. The laboratory part conducted at laboratories of\r\nNational Research Centre, Animal Production Department,\r\nEgypt, and By-Products Research Department, Animal\r\nProduction Research Institute, Agricultural Research\r\nCenter, Egypt.\r\nExtracts of Olive Leaves and Olive Pomace\r\nOlive leaves and pomace were extracted using 65\r\npercent ethanol with vigorous stirring for three hours\r\nadopting a heat reflux extraction procedure. The extract\r\nwas then separated at 40°C using a rotary evaporator\r\n(Loghmanifar et al. 2020; Elsherif et al. 2021). Finally,\r\nCalcium carbonate was added as a carrier material to load\r\nthe extracts separately, giving them the ability to use and\r\nmix with feed ingredients.\r\nExperimental Diets\r\nAccording to Agriculture Ministry Decree, 1996\r\nrequirements, the control diet was formed to meet all the\r\nnutritional needs of growing rabbits. Control (without\r\nadditives), OLE1 (Olive leaves extract, 200ppm), OLE2\r\n(olive leaves extract, 400ppm), OPE1 (olive pomace\r\nextract, 200ppm) and OPE2 (olive pomace extract,\r\n400ppm) were the five treatments. The experiment lasted\r\n56 days (from 42-98 days of age). Table 1 shows the\r\ncomposition of the control diet as well as the computed\r\nanalyses.\r\nAnimals and Management\r\nSeventy-five APRI growing rabbits were divided into\r\nfive groups of 15 rabbits each at 42 days of age (624g\r\naverage body weight). Rabbits were kept in battery cages\r\nwith separate feeding units. Water and diets were available\r\nad libitum. All the rabbits were kept in the same sanitary\r\nand managerial settings. Weekly feed intake and live body\r\nweight were recorded and the feed efficiency and body\r\nweight gained were computed.\r\nDigestibility Trail\r\nAt the end of this experiment, seven rabbits from each\r\ngroup were used in a digestibility test. Feces were collected\r\ndaily, weighed, dried at 60°C for 24 hours, roughly\r\npowdered, and stored for AOAC, 2000 chemical analysis.\r\nAccording to Pérez et al. (1995), the coefficients of\r\ndigestion and nutritional values of the dietary treatments\r\nwere calculated using data from amounts and chemical\r\nanalyses of feed and feces.\r\nCarcass Characteristics and Blood Samples\r\nFive rabbits from each treatment were starved for 24\r\nhours and slaughtered for carcass and internal organs at the\r\nend of the experiment. The percentages of carcass and\r\norgans as a percentage of live weights were calculated.\r\nBlood samples were taken from the slaughtered rabbits as\r\nwell.\r\nAnalyses of Antioxidants Status\r\nBlood serum samples were separated by centrifugation\r\nat 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, then stored at -20°C until\r\nchemical analysis. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and\r\nmalondialdehyde (MDA) levels in blood serum were\r\nexamined. The livers were also obtained for the\r\nmeasurement of hepatic CAT, SOD, and GSH antioxidant\r\nenzymes in an automated calibration spectrophotometer\r\nwith high-performance readings (bio diagnostic, Cairo,\r\nEgypt) (FlexorEL200 Biochemical Analyzer).\r\nThyroid Hormone Concentration\r\nTotal T3 and T4 levels in the blood were measured\r\nusing commercial ELISA kits (MyBioSource, Inc., San\r\nDiego, CA). By dividing the T3 value by the T4 value, the\r\nT3/T4 ratio was computed.\r\nCecum pH, Ammonia Nitrogen Concentration and\r\nTotal Volatile Fatty Acids\r\nCecum contents samples were taken from slaughtered\r\nrabbits and utilized to measure cecum pH using a digital pH\r\nmeter immediately. Conway (1958) technique was used to\r\ndetermine the ammonia nitrogen concentration. According\r\nto Eadie et al. (1967), the total volatile fatty acids in caecum were determined using steam distillation unit.\r\nEconomic Efficiency At the end of the trial period, the economic efficiency profit of rabbit production were calculated using the following formula:\r\n➢ (Total feed cost + additives cost) Equals total cost per rabbit.\r\n➢ (Body weight gain (kg) x selling price of kg rabbit) Equals total return per rabbit (Egyptian pound, L.E).\r\n➢ Total return per rabbit - total cost per rabbit equals net return per rabbit (L.E.).\r\n➢ Net return per rabbit divided by total cost per rabbit equals economic efficiency (L.E.).\r\n➢ Economic efficiency of each treatment calculated for each one with multiplying by 100 (control economic efficiency).\r\n\r\n', 'Performance Parameters\r\nTable 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on body weight (bwt), weight gain (WG), feed\r\nintake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in growing\r\nrabbits. The results revealed that adding 200ppm (OLE1,\r\nOPE1) or 400ppm (OLE2, OPE2) of olive leaves extract or\r\nolive pomace extract raised the final bwt linearly (P<0.05).\r\nIn comparison to the control diet, which had a final body\r\nweight of 2011g, OPE1 had the highest value (2175g).\r\nThere were no significant variations in bwt between the\r\ngroups given OLE or OPE at the two levels tested. The\r\naddition of OLE or OPE greatly improved WG at all ages,\r\nand the results of WG followed the same trend as bwt. OPE\r\nhad a better effect on WG than OLE, although there were\r\nno significant differences between them. The feed intake of\r\nrabbits fed varied amounts of OLE or OPE in their diets\r\nwas unaffected linearly (P<0.05). In terms of FCR, adding\r\nOLE or OPE to growing rabbit diets enhanced FCR linearly\r\n(P<0.05) during the period of the trial compared to the\r\ncontrol group. The addition of OPE improved FCR more\r\nthan the addition of OLE. At the overall ages of the rabbits,\r\nthe results of the performance index (PI percent) and\r\nrelative growth rate (RGR percent) demonstrated\r\nsignificant (P<0.05) differences across the dietary\r\ntreatments. In comparison to the control, adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the rabbits\' diets enhanced PI and RGR\r\nconsiderably. The rabbits fed on OPE1-enriched diet had\r\nthe highest PI and RGR with values 69.31 and 113.12,\r\nrespectively. In terms of PI and RGR, there were no\r\nsignificant changes between OLE and OPE.\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nTable 3 shows the effect of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on the digestibility coefficients and nutritional\r\nvalues of growing rabbits. The addition of OLE or OPE had\r\nno effect on the digestibility coefficients of CF, EE, or\r\nNFE. The addition of OLE or OPE raised the digestibility\r\ncoefficient of CP substantially (P<0.05). The groups fed\r\nOLE2 and OPE2 had the best digestibility coefficients for\r\nDM, OM and CP. When compared to the control, the\r\naddition of OLE or OPE significantly (P<0.05) enhanced\r\ntotal digestible nutrients (TDN), digestible energy (DE),\r\nand digestible crude protein (DCP).\r\nCarcass Characteristics\r\nTable 4 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\ncarcass traits. The addition of OLE or OLP enhanced\r\nsignificantly (P<0.05) carcass percent. The groups\r\nsupplemented with OLE2 or OPE2 had the highest carcass\r\npercent. The proportion of live body weight of the liver,\r\nheart, kidney, giblets, and spleen did not change because of\r\nthe varied additions. The control group had the greatest\r\nGIT percent, and dietary treatments supplementation with\r\ndifferent levels of extracts significantly (P<0.05) reduced\r\nGIT weight as a proportion of live body weight.\r\nAntioxidant Status\r\nTable 5 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\nrabbit antioxidant enzymes. When compared to the control\r\ngroup, the addition of olive leaves extract or olive pomace\r\nextract at 200 and 400ppm significantly improved total\r\nantioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD),\r\nand catalase (CAT). MDA, on the other hand, was\r\nconsiderably (P<0.05) reduced when OLE or OPE were\r\nadded.\r\nThyroid Hormones\r\nThe results of thyroid hormones were found in\r\ngrowing rabbits, as shown in Fig. 1. The addition of olive\r\nleaves extract or olive pomace extract to growing rabbit\r\ndiets at 200 or 400 ppm had no effect on T3, T4, or T4/T3\r\nin any of the groups.\r\nCaecum Fermentation Activities\r\nFig. 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and olive\r\npomace extracts on caecum total volatile fatty acids\r\n(TVFAs), ammonia nitrogen and pH. The addition of OLE\r\nor OPE had a significant (P<0.05) influence on caecum\r\nTVFAs and ammonia concentrations. The TVFA values for\r\nthe treatment groups varied from 4.16 to 4.14 (ml\r\neq/100mL) compared to 3.85 for the control group.\r\nTreatment ammonia concentrations were from 8.49 to 8.32\r\nmg/100mL, compared to 9.76mg/100 ml for the control.\r\nThe pH levels were unaffected and varied from 5.80 to 5.57\r\nfor the treatment groups compared to 5.97 for the control\r\ngroup.\r\nEconomic Efficiency\r\nTable 6 shows the impact of dietary treatments on\r\neconomic efficiency (EE) and relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE). The results showed that adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the diet of rabbits improved their relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE) compared to the control group. When\r\ncompared to the control diet, REE levels increased by\r\n13.56 and 18.64 percent with OLE1 and OLE2, and by\r\n25.42 and 19.49 percent with OPE1 and OPE2 for rabbit\r\ndiets, respectively.', 'Performance Parameters\r\nResults finding are confirmed by Oke et al. (2017),\r\nwho detected that supplementing olive leaves extract in the\r\ndrinking water of broiler chicks enhanced final body\r\nweight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio linearly\r\n(P<0.05). The induction of antimicrobial activity with olive\r\nleaves extract components may be linked to growth\r\nperformance improvements of broilers fed with OLE in\r\ndrinking water (10mL/L) (Jabri et al. 2017). Furthermore,\r\nthe enhanced performance rate of rabbits given olive leaves extract might be attributable to the antioxidant,\r\nantibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral\r\ncharacteristics of olive leaves extract (Aliabadi et al. 2012).\r\nAccording to Shafey et al. (2013), adding olive leaves\r\nextract (0, 1.8, 3.6, and 6.25g/kg) to broiler diets had no\r\neffect on feed consumption. According to Bahsi et al.\r\n(2016), adding 400 ppm of oleuropein to Japanese quail\r\nmeal boosted feed conversion ratio considerably. Ahmed et\r\nal. (2017) found that feeding laying hens 50, 100, or 150mg\r\nof oleuropein/kg diet enhanced egg production, egg mass,\r\nand feed conversion ratio considerably. Héla et al. (2019)\r\nfound that adding olive leaves aqueous extract to the\r\ndrinking water of developing rabbits at a concentration of\r\n20ml/L boosted daily body weight growth and feed\r\nconversion ratio linearly (P<0.05). The inclusion of 750\r\nppm of an olive pomace extract containing 10% total\r\ntriterpenes and 2% polyphenols considerably increased\r\nbroiler chick development performance (Herrero-Encinas\r\net al 2020). When OLE (75, 150, 300 and 600mg/kg) was\r\nadded to broiler chicken diets, body weight gain, carcass\r\nweight, and feed conversion ratio were improved (P<0.05)\r\nlinearly (Erener et al. 2020). The results of current study\r\nfound that enhanced growth performance in rabbits given\r\nOLE or OPE might be linked to FCR, digestive enzyme\r\nactivity, and nutrient absorption improvement, as well as\r\ncontrolling the gut microbiota, these findings also agreed\r\nwith the findings of Zeng et al. (2015).\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nThe inclusion of OLE2 and OPE2 resulted in the\r\ngreatest improvement in TDN, DCP, and DE percent. In\r\nterms of TDN, DCP, and DE percent, there were no\r\nsignificance differences between OLE1 and control.\r\nBroiler diets which contain olive leaves extracts, enhancing growth performance and feed efficiency due to the\r\nimprovement in nutritional digestibility, digestive enzyme\r\nactivation, and intestinal morphology (Leskovec et al.\r\n2018). This improvement might be attributed to a decrease\r\nin digesta viscosity, which boosts nutrient and enzyme\r\ndiffusion rates, allowing the animal to digest and absorb\r\nmore nutrients, resulting in improved intestinal health\r\n(Morrison et al. 2017). Furthermore, phenolic compounds\r\nin olive leaves can act as antioxidants and antibacterial,\r\nresulting in the growth of beneficial microflora and the\r\ndegradation of harmful or pathogenic microflora in the\r\ndigestive tract and caecum, resulting in improved nutrient\r\ndigestibility (Korukluoglu et al. 2010; Hamad 2015; Sarica\r\nand Ürkmez 2016; Thielmann et al. 2017; Elsherif et al. 2021).', 'These results suggested that including 200 and\r\n400ppm of olive leaves or olive pomace extracts into the\r\ndiet of growing rabbits might increase growth, carcass\r\ncharacteristics, antioxidant status, and economic efficiency\r\nwithout any negative effect on their health', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'Abaza L, Taamalli A, Nsir H and Zarrouk M, 2015.

Metabolic disorders occur when the body\'s normal metabolic process is disrupted by abnormal chemical reactions. It can also be characterized as a hereditary single gene aberration, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (Zheng et al. 2021). Physical inactivity, cigarette smoking and an elevated BMI are all\r\nlifestyle risk factors. Other causes include hypertension, poor glucose metabolism and high blood pressure and\r\ncholesterol concentration contribute to these disorders (Akhuemonkhan and Lazo 2017). Lethargy, weight loss, jaundice, and seizures are some of the signs of metabolic diseases. Symptoms would differ depending on the type of metabolic disease. Acute symptoms, late-onset acute\r\nsymptoms, gradual general symptoms, and persistent symptoms are the four types of symptoms (Agana et al. 2018; Mendrick et al. 2018). Inherited metabolic diseases\r\nare a type of metabolic disorder caused by a faulty gene that results in an enzyme deficit. Inborn errors of metabolism are a group of disorders with a variety of subtypes. When the liver or pancreas does not function properly, metabolic disorders might develop. Fig. 1 represented some types of metabolic disorders (Hernández-Granados et al. 2018). Any sickness or disorder that affects the human reproductive system is referred to as reproductive disorders.\r\nImproper hormone yielding via ovaries or testes, as well as other endocrine glands is among them . Genetic or congenital\r\ndefects, infections, tumors, or disorders of unknown sources can all cause these diseases (Hutson et al. 2014) .\r\nGenetic abnormalities, genital anomalies, infections,\r\nstructural differences, and cancers are the primary divisions of these disorders (Rawal and Austin 2015; Elshazly et al.\r\n2019). Symptoms of reproductive disorders are bleeding in between periods and within it, itching, burning of the\r\ngenital area, and pain during sex, severe pelvic/abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination (Hutson et\r\nal. 2014). Common reproductive conditions for human females are anomalies of the clitoris, vagina and uterus,\r\nabnormalities of menstrual cycle endometriosis, cancers, polycystic ovarian syndrome and diseases as AIDS,\r\nsyphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital herpes. And in men are pseudo hermaphroditism, anomalies of the penis,\r\nurethra, testes, prostate gland and seminal vesicles, Impotence, benign prostatic hyperplasia, Priapism,\r\ntesticular cancer and prostate disease. Intersexuality syndrome as Klinefelter, Turner, and testicular feminization. Delayed and precocious puberty in both\r\n(Rawal and Austin 2015). Infertility is one of the most serious issues that is worsening by the day and endangering\r\nthe human generation\'s future. Varicocele reduces sperm morphology and improves sperm count in people with aberrant morphology. Ovarian, cervical and prostate cancers are the deadliest of reproductive cancers. Some risk\r\nfactors for this malignancy include age, history of family and late menopause. While pregnant and breastfeeding, the\r\nlikelihood of occurrence is reduced (Salehi et al. 2008). There is a relation between metabolic and reproductive\r\ndisorders as diabetic complications can lead to some reproductive disorder as subfertility, delayed puberty or\r\ndisturbance in the menstrual cycle. Reproductive difficulties can appear early in adolescence, later, or during\r\nthe climacteric period, relying on the age at which diabetes is discovered. Decreased concentrations of LH, FSH and\r\nestradiol occurred in type 2 human studies (Gnanadass et al. 2021).\r\nBecause of central hypogonadism, women with type 1 diabetes sometimes have amenorrhoea, polycystic ovarian\r\nsyndrome and hyperandrogenism, and infertility that can be controlled by insulin administration and improved\r\nmetabolic disorder (Codner et al. 2012). Also, type 2 diabetes is related to other reproductive disorders like obesity and insulin resistance related to polycystic ovarian syndrome due to improper lifestyle. Although pubertal breast development appears to be delayed in type 1 diabetes, some people with type 1 diabetes still experience a small delay in menarche due to diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy (Calcaterra et al. 2021). The most common menstrual cycle abnormalities are oligomenorrhoea and\r\nprolonged cycle length that are related to patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, studies revealed that these disturbances\r\nare more than six times than normal women without diabetes. Disturbance in BMI, sex steroid and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations is also related to\r\ntype 2 diabetes (Thong et al. 2021).', 'Study Ethical Approval\r\nThe authors confirm that the ethical policies of the\r\njournal have been adhered to and the appropriate ethical\r\nreview committee approval has been received. The authors\r\nfollowed EU standards for the protection of animals used\r\nfor scientific purposes. The experimental work was\r\nconducted at Sakha Research Station in Kafrelsheikh\r\nGovernorate, Animal Production Research Institute,\r\nAgricultural Research Center, the Ministry of Agriculture,\r\nEgypt. The laboratory part conducted at laboratories of\r\nNational Research Centre, Animal Production Department,\r\nEgypt, and By-Products Research Department, Animal\r\nProduction Research Institute, Agricultural Research\r\nCenter, Egypt.\r\nExtracts of Olive Leaves and Olive Pomace\r\nOlive leaves and pomace were extracted using 65\r\npercent ethanol with vigorous stirring for three hours\r\nadopting a heat reflux extraction procedure. The extract\r\nwas then separated at 40°C using a rotary evaporator\r\n(Loghmanifar et al. 2020; Elsherif et al. 2021). Finally,\r\nCalcium carbonate was added as a carrier material to load\r\nthe extracts separately, giving them the ability to use and\r\nmix with feed ingredients.\r\nExperimental Diets\r\nAccording to Agriculture Ministry Decree, 1996\r\nrequirements, the control diet was formed to meet all the\r\nnutritional needs of growing rabbits. Control (without\r\nadditives), OLE1 (Olive leaves extract, 200ppm), OLE2\r\n(olive leaves extract, 400ppm), OPE1 (olive pomace\r\nextract, 200ppm) and OPE2 (olive pomace extract,\r\n400ppm) were the five treatments. The experiment lasted\r\n56 days (from 42-98 days of age). Table 1 shows the\r\ncomposition of the control diet as well as the computed\r\nanalyses.\r\nAnimals and Management\r\nSeventy-five APRI growing rabbits were divided into\r\nfive groups of 15 rabbits each at 42 days of age (624g\r\naverage body weight). Rabbits were kept in battery cages\r\nwith separate feeding units. Water and diets were available\r\nad libitum. All the rabbits were kept in the same sanitary\r\nand managerial settings. Weekly feed intake and live body\r\nweight were recorded and the feed efficiency and body\r\nweight gained were computed.\r\nDigestibility Trail\r\nAt the end of this experiment, seven rabbits from each\r\ngroup were used in a digestibility test. Feces were collected\r\ndaily, weighed, dried at 60°C for 24 hours, roughly\r\npowdered, and stored for AOAC, 2000 chemical analysis.\r\nAccording to Pérez et al. (1995), the coefficients of\r\ndigestion and nutritional values of the dietary treatments\r\nwere calculated using data from amounts and chemical\r\nanalyses of feed and feces.\r\nCarcass Characteristics and Blood Samples\r\nFive rabbits from each treatment were starved for 24\r\nhours and slaughtered for carcass and internal organs at the\r\nend of the experiment. The percentages of carcass and\r\norgans as a percentage of live weights were calculated.\r\nBlood samples were taken from the slaughtered rabbits as\r\nwell.\r\nAnalyses of Antioxidants Status\r\nBlood serum samples were separated by centrifugation\r\nat 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, then stored at -20°C until\r\nchemical analysis. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and\r\nmalondialdehyde (MDA) levels in blood serum were\r\nexamined. The livers were also obtained for the\r\nmeasurement of hepatic CAT, SOD, and GSH antioxidant\r\nenzymes in an automated calibration spectrophotometer\r\nwith high-performance readings (bio diagnostic, Cairo,\r\nEgypt) (FlexorEL200 Biochemical Analyzer).\r\nThyroid Hormone Concentration\r\nTotal T3 and T4 levels in the blood were measured\r\nusing commercial ELISA kits (MyBioSource, Inc., San\r\nDiego, CA). By dividing the T3 value by the T4 value, the\r\nT3/T4 ratio was computed.\r\nCecum pH, Ammonia Nitrogen Concentration and\r\nTotal Volatile Fatty Acids\r\nCecum contents samples were taken from slaughtered\r\nrabbits and utilized to measure cecum pH using a digital pH\r\nmeter immediately. Conway (1958) technique was used to\r\ndetermine the ammonia nitrogen concentration. According\r\nto Eadie et al. (1967), the total volatile fatty acids in caecum were determined using steam distillation unit.\r\nEconomic Efficiency At the end of the trial period, the economic efficiency profit of rabbit production were calculated using the following formula:\r\n➢ (Total feed cost + additives cost) Equals total cost per rabbit.\r\n➢ (Body weight gain (kg) x selling price of kg rabbit) Equals total return per rabbit (Egyptian pound, L.E).\r\n➢ Total return per rabbit - total cost per rabbit equals net return per rabbit (L.E.).\r\n➢ Net return per rabbit divided by total cost per rabbit equals economic efficiency (L.E.).\r\n➢ Economic efficiency of each treatment calculated for each one with multiplying by 100 (control economic efficiency).\r\n\r\n', 'Performance Parameters\r\nTable 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on body weight (bwt), weight gain (WG), feed\r\nintake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in growing\r\nrabbits. The results revealed that adding 200ppm (OLE1,\r\nOPE1) or 400ppm (OLE2, OPE2) of olive leaves extract or\r\nolive pomace extract raised the final bwt linearly (P<0.05).\r\nIn comparison to the control diet, which had a final body\r\nweight of 2011g, OPE1 had the highest value (2175g).\r\nThere were no significant variations in bwt between the\r\ngroups given OLE or OPE at the two levels tested. The\r\naddition of OLE or OPE greatly improved WG at all ages,\r\nand the results of WG followed the same trend as bwt. OPE\r\nhad a better effect on WG than OLE, although there were\r\nno significant differences between them. The feed intake of\r\nrabbits fed varied amounts of OLE or OPE in their diets\r\nwas unaffected linearly (P<0.05). In terms of FCR, adding\r\nOLE or OPE to growing rabbit diets enhanced FCR linearly\r\n(P<0.05) during the period of the trial compared to the\r\ncontrol group. The addition of OPE improved FCR more\r\nthan the addition of OLE. At the overall ages of the rabbits,\r\nthe results of the performance index (PI percent) and\r\nrelative growth rate (RGR percent) demonstrated\r\nsignificant (P<0.05) differences across the dietary\r\ntreatments. In comparison to the control, adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the rabbits\' diets enhanced PI and RGR\r\nconsiderably. The rabbits fed on OPE1-enriched diet had\r\nthe highest PI and RGR with values 69.31 and 113.12,\r\nrespectively. In terms of PI and RGR, there were no\r\nsignificant changes between OLE and OPE.\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nTable 3 shows the effect of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on the digestibility coefficients and nutritional\r\nvalues of growing rabbits. The addition of OLE or OPE had\r\nno effect on the digestibility coefficients of CF, EE, or\r\nNFE. The addition of OLE or OPE raised the digestibility\r\ncoefficient of CP substantially (P<0.05). The groups fed\r\nOLE2 and OPE2 had the best digestibility coefficients for\r\nDM, OM and CP. When compared to the control, the\r\naddition of OLE or OPE significantly (P<0.05) enhanced\r\ntotal digestible nutrients (TDN), digestible energy (DE),\r\nand digestible crude protein (DCP).\r\nCarcass Characteristics\r\nTable 4 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\ncarcass traits. The addition of OLE or OLP enhanced\r\nsignificantly (P<0.05) carcass percent. The groups\r\nsupplemented with OLE2 or OPE2 had the highest carcass\r\npercent. The proportion of live body weight of the liver,\r\nheart, kidney, giblets, and spleen did not change because of\r\nthe varied additions. The control group had the greatest\r\nGIT percent, and dietary treatments supplementation with\r\ndifferent levels of extracts significantly (P<0.05) reduced\r\nGIT weight as a proportion of live body weight.\r\nAntioxidant Status\r\nTable 5 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\nrabbit antioxidant enzymes. When compared to the control\r\ngroup, the addition of olive leaves extract or olive pomace\r\nextract at 200 and 400ppm significantly improved total\r\nantioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD),\r\nand catalase (CAT). MDA, on the other hand, was\r\nconsiderably (P<0.05) reduced when OLE or OPE were\r\nadded.\r\nThyroid Hormones\r\nThe results of thyroid hormones were found in\r\ngrowing rabbits, as shown in Fig. 1. The addition of olive\r\nleaves extract or olive pomace extract to growing rabbit\r\ndiets at 200 or 400 ppm had no effect on T3, T4, or T4/T3\r\nin any of the groups.\r\nCaecum Fermentation Activities\r\nFig. 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and olive\r\npomace extracts on caecum total volatile fatty acids\r\n(TVFAs), ammonia nitrogen and pH. The addition of OLE\r\nor OPE had a significant (P<0.05) influence on caecum\r\nTVFAs and ammonia concentrations. The TVFA values for\r\nthe treatment groups varied from 4.16 to 4.14 (ml\r\neq/100mL) compared to 3.85 for the control group.\r\nTreatment ammonia concentrations were from 8.49 to 8.32\r\nmg/100mL, compared to 9.76mg/100 ml for the control.\r\nThe pH levels were unaffected and varied from 5.80 to 5.57\r\nfor the treatment groups compared to 5.97 for the control\r\ngroup.\r\nEconomic Efficiency\r\nTable 6 shows the impact of dietary treatments on\r\neconomic efficiency (EE) and relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE). The results showed that adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the diet of rabbits improved their relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE) compared to the control group. When\r\ncompared to the control diet, REE levels increased by\r\n13.56 and 18.64 percent with OLE1 and OLE2, and by\r\n25.42 and 19.49 percent with OPE1 and OPE2 for rabbit\r\ndiets, respectively.', 'Performance Parameters\r\nResults finding are confirmed by Oke et al. (2017),\r\nwho detected that supplementing olive leaves extract in the\r\ndrinking water of broiler chicks enhanced final body\r\nweight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio linearly\r\n(P<0.05). The induction of antimicrobial activity with olive\r\nleaves extract components may be linked to growth\r\nperformance improvements of broilers fed with OLE in\r\ndrinking water (10mL/L) (Jabri et al. 2017). Furthermore,\r\nthe enhanced performance rate of rabbits given olive leaves extract might be attributable to the antioxidant,\r\nantibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral\r\ncharacteristics of olive leaves extract (Aliabadi et al. 2012).\r\nAccording to Shafey et al. (2013), adding olive leaves\r\nextract (0, 1.8, 3.6, and 6.25g/kg) to broiler diets had no\r\neffect on feed consumption. According to Bahsi et al.\r\n(2016), adding 400 ppm of oleuropein to Japanese quail\r\nmeal boosted feed conversion ratio considerably. Ahmed et\r\nal. (2017) found that feeding laying hens 50, 100, or 150mg\r\nof oleuropein/kg diet enhanced egg production, egg mass,\r\nand feed conversion ratio considerably. Héla et al. (2019)\r\nfound that adding olive leaves aqueous extract to the\r\ndrinking water of developing rabbits at a concentration of\r\n20ml/L boosted daily body weight growth and feed\r\nconversion ratio linearly (P<0.05). The inclusion of 750\r\nppm of an olive pomace extract containing 10% total\r\ntriterpenes and 2% polyphenols considerably increased\r\nbroiler chick development performance (Herrero-Encinas\r\net al 2020). When OLE (75, 150, 300 and 600mg/kg) was\r\nadded to broiler chicken diets, body weight gain, carcass\r\nweight, and feed conversion ratio were improved (P<0.05)\r\nlinearly (Erener et al. 2020). The results of current study\r\nfound that enhanced growth performance in rabbits given\r\nOLE or OPE might be linked to FCR, digestive enzyme\r\nactivity, and nutrient absorption improvement, as well as\r\ncontrolling the gut microbiota, these findings also agreed\r\nwith the findings of Zeng et al. (2015).\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nThe inclusion of OLE2 and OPE2 resulted in the\r\ngreatest improvement in TDN, DCP, and DE percent. In\r\nterms of TDN, DCP, and DE percent, there were no\r\nsignificance differences between OLE1 and control.\r\nBroiler diets which contain olive leaves extracts, enhancing growth performance and feed efficiency due to the\r\nimprovement in nutritional digestibility, digestive enzyme\r\nactivation, and intestinal morphology (Leskovec et al.\r\n2018). This improvement might be attributed to a decrease\r\nin digesta viscosity, which boosts nutrient and enzyme\r\ndiffusion rates, allowing the animal to digest and absorb\r\nmore nutrients, resulting in improved intestinal health\r\n(Morrison et al. 2017). Furthermore, phenolic compounds\r\nin olive leaves can act as antioxidants and antibacterial,\r\nresulting in the growth of beneficial microflora and the\r\ndegradation of harmful or pathogenic microflora in the\r\ndigestive tract and caecum, resulting in improved nutrient\r\ndigestibility (Korukluoglu et al. 2010; Hamad 2015; Sarica\r\nand Ürkmez 2016; Thielmann et al. 2017; Elsherif et al. 2021).', 'These results suggested that including 200 and\r\n400ppm of olive leaves or olive pomace extracts into the\r\ndiet of growing rabbits might increase growth, carcass\r\ncharacteristics, antioxidant status, and economic efficiency\r\nwithout any negative effect on their health', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'Abaza L, Taamalli A, Nsir H and Zarrouk M, 2015.

Metabolic disorders occur when the body\'s normal metabolic process is disrupted by abnormal chemical reactions. It can also be characterized as a hereditary single gene aberration, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (Zheng et al. 2021). Physical inactivity, cigarette smoking and an elevated BMI are all\r\nlifestyle risk factors. Other causes include hypertension, poor glucose metabolism and high blood pressure and\r\ncholesterol concentration contribute to these disorders (Akhuemonkhan and Lazo 2017). Lethargy, weight loss, jaundice, and seizures are some of the signs of metabolic diseases. Symptoms would differ depending on the type of metabolic disease. Acute symptoms, late-onset acute\r\nsymptoms, gradual general symptoms, and persistent symptoms are the four types of symptoms (Agana et al. 2018; Mendrick et al. 2018). Inherited metabolic diseases\r\nare a type of metabolic disorder caused by a faulty gene that results in an enzyme deficit. Inborn errors of metabolism are a group of disorders with a variety of subtypes. When the liver or pancreas does not function properly, metabolic disorders might develop. Fig. 1 represented some types of metabolic disorders (Hernández-Granados et al. 2018). Any sickness or disorder that affects the human reproductive system is referred to as reproductive disorders.\r\nImproper hormone yielding via ovaries or testes, as well as other endocrine glands is among them . Genetic or congenital\r\ndefects, infections, tumors, or disorders of unknown sources can all cause these diseases (Hutson et al. 2014) .\r\nGenetic abnormalities, genital anomalies, infections,\r\nstructural differences, and cancers are the primary divisions of these disorders (Rawal and Austin 2015; Elshazly et al.\r\n2019). Symptoms of reproductive disorders are bleeding in between periods and within it, itching, burning of the\r\ngenital area, and pain during sex, severe pelvic/abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination (Hutson et\r\nal. 2014). Common reproductive conditions for human females are anomalies of the clitoris, vagina and uterus,\r\nabnormalities of menstrual cycle endometriosis, cancers, polycystic ovarian syndrome and diseases as AIDS,\r\nsyphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital herpes. And in men are pseudo hermaphroditism, anomalies of the penis,\r\nurethra, testes, prostate gland and seminal vesicles, Impotence, benign prostatic hyperplasia, Priapism,\r\ntesticular cancer and prostate disease. Intersexuality syndrome as Klinefelter, Turner, and testicular feminization. Delayed and precocious puberty in both\r\n(Rawal and Austin 2015). Infertility is one of the most serious issues that is worsening by the day and endangering\r\nthe human generation\'s future. Varicocele reduces sperm morphology and improves sperm count in people with aberrant morphology. Ovarian, cervical and prostate cancers are the deadliest of reproductive cancers. Some risk\r\nfactors for this malignancy include age, history of family and late menopause. While pregnant and breastfeeding, the\r\nlikelihood of occurrence is reduced (Salehi et al. 2008). There is a relation between metabolic and reproductive\r\ndisorders as diabetic complications can lead to some reproductive disorder as subfertility, delayed puberty or\r\ndisturbance in the menstrual cycle. Reproductive difficulties can appear early in adolescence, later, or during\r\nthe climacteric period, relying on the age at which diabetes is discovered. Decreased concentrations of LH, FSH and\r\nestradiol occurred in type 2 human studies (Gnanadass et al. 2021).\r\nBecause of central hypogonadism, women with type 1 diabetes sometimes have amenorrhoea, polycystic ovarian\r\nsyndrome and hyperandrogenism, and infertility that can be controlled by insulin administration and improved\r\nmetabolic disorder (Codner et al. 2012). Also, type 2 diabetes is related to other reproductive disorders like obesity and insulin resistance related to polycystic ovarian syndrome due to improper lifestyle. Although pubertal breast development appears to be delayed in type 1 diabetes, some people with type 1 diabetes still experience a small delay in menarche due to diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy (Calcaterra et al. 2021). The most common menstrual cycle abnormalities are oligomenorrhoea and\r\nprolonged cycle length that are related to patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, studies revealed that these disturbances\r\nare more than six times than normal women without diabetes. Disturbance in BMI, sex steroid and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations is also related to\r\ntype 2 diabetes (Thong et al. 2021).', 'Study Ethical Approval\r\nThe authors confirm that the ethical policies of the\r\njournal have been adhered to and the appropriate ethical\r\nreview committee approval has been received. The authors\r\nfollowed EU standards for the protection of animals used\r\nfor scientific purposes. The experimental work was\r\nconducted at Sakha Research Station in Kafrelsheikh\r\nGovernorate, Animal Production Research Institute,\r\nAgricultural Research Center, the Ministry of Agriculture,\r\nEgypt. The laboratory part conducted at laboratories of\r\nNational Research Centre, Animal Production Department,\r\nEgypt, and By-Products Research Department, Animal\r\nProduction Research Institute, Agricultural Research\r\nCenter, Egypt.\r\nExtracts of Olive Leaves and Olive Pomace\r\nOlive leaves and pomace were extracted using 65\r\npercent ethanol with vigorous stirring for three hours\r\nadopting a heat reflux extraction procedure. The extract\r\nwas then separated at 40°C using a rotary evaporator\r\n(Loghmanifar et al. 2020; Elsherif et al. 2021). Finally,\r\nCalcium carbonate was added as a carrier material to load\r\nthe extracts separately, giving them the ability to use and\r\nmix with feed ingredients.\r\nExperimental Diets\r\nAccording to Agriculture Ministry Decree, 1996\r\nrequirements, the control diet was formed to meet all the\r\nnutritional needs of growing rabbits. Control (without\r\nadditives), OLE1 (Olive leaves extract, 200ppm), OLE2\r\n(olive leaves extract, 400ppm), OPE1 (olive pomace\r\nextract, 200ppm) and OPE2 (olive pomace extract,\r\n400ppm) were the five treatments. The experiment lasted\r\n56 days (from 42-98 days of age). Table 1 shows the\r\ncomposition of the control diet as well as the computed\r\nanalyses.\r\nAnimals and Management\r\nSeventy-five APRI growing rabbits were divided into\r\nfive groups of 15 rabbits each at 42 days of age (624g\r\naverage body weight). Rabbits were kept in battery cages\r\nwith separate feeding units. Water and diets were available\r\nad libitum. All the rabbits were kept in the same sanitary\r\nand managerial settings. Weekly feed intake and live body\r\nweight were recorded and the feed efficiency and body\r\nweight gained were computed.\r\nDigestibility Trail\r\nAt the end of this experiment, seven rabbits from each\r\ngroup were used in a digestibility test. Feces were collected\r\ndaily, weighed, dried at 60°C for 24 hours, roughly\r\npowdered, and stored for AOAC, 2000 chemical analysis.\r\nAccording to Pérez et al. (1995), the coefficients of\r\ndigestion and nutritional values of the dietary treatments\r\nwere calculated using data from amounts and chemical\r\nanalyses of feed and feces.\r\nCarcass Characteristics and Blood Samples\r\nFive rabbits from each treatment were starved for 24\r\nhours and slaughtered for carcass and internal organs at the\r\nend of the experiment. The percentages of carcass and\r\norgans as a percentage of live weights were calculated.\r\nBlood samples were taken from the slaughtered rabbits as\r\nwell.\r\nAnalyses of Antioxidants Status\r\nBlood serum samples were separated by centrifugation\r\nat 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, then stored at -20°C until\r\nchemical analysis. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and\r\nmalondialdehyde (MDA) levels in blood serum were\r\nexamined. The livers were also obtained for the\r\nmeasurement of hepatic CAT, SOD, and GSH antioxidant\r\nenzymes in an automated calibration spectrophotometer\r\nwith high-performance readings (bio diagnostic, Cairo,\r\nEgypt) (FlexorEL200 Biochemical Analyzer).\r\nThyroid Hormone Concentration\r\nTotal T3 and T4 levels in the blood were measured\r\nusing commercial ELISA kits (MyBioSource, Inc., San\r\nDiego, CA). By dividing the T3 value by the T4 value, the\r\nT3/T4 ratio was computed.\r\nCecum pH, Ammonia Nitrogen Concentration and\r\nTotal Volatile Fatty Acids\r\nCecum contents samples were taken from slaughtered\r\nrabbits and utilized to measure cecum pH using a digital pH\r\nmeter immediately. Conway (1958) technique was used to\r\ndetermine the ammonia nitrogen concentration. According\r\nto Eadie et al. (1967), the total volatile fatty acids in caecum were determined using steam distillation unit.\r\nEconomic Efficiency At the end of the trial period, the economic efficiency profit of rabbit production were calculated using the following formula:\r\n➢ (Total feed cost + additives cost) Equals total cost per rabbit.\r\n➢ (Body weight gain (kg) x selling price of kg rabbit) Equals total return per rabbit (Egyptian pound, L.E).\r\n➢ Total return per rabbit - total cost per rabbit equals net return per rabbit (L.E.).\r\n➢ Net return per rabbit divided by total cost per rabbit equals economic efficiency (L.E.).\r\n➢ Economic efficiency of each treatment calculated for each one with multiplying by 100 (control economic efficiency).\r\n\r\n', 'Performance Parameters\r\nTable 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on body weight (bwt), weight gain (WG), feed\r\nintake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in growing\r\nrabbits. The results revealed that adding 200ppm (OLE1,\r\nOPE1) or 400ppm (OLE2, OPE2) of olive leaves extract or\r\nolive pomace extract raised the final bwt linearly (P<0.05).\r\nIn comparison to the control diet, which had a final body\r\nweight of 2011g, OPE1 had the highest value (2175g).\r\nThere were no significant variations in bwt between the\r\ngroups given OLE or OPE at the two levels tested. The\r\naddition of OLE or OPE greatly improved WG at all ages,\r\nand the results of WG followed the same trend as bwt. OPE\r\nhad a better effect on WG than OLE, although there were\r\nno significant differences between them. The feed intake of\r\nrabbits fed varied amounts of OLE or OPE in their diets\r\nwas unaffected linearly (P<0.05). In terms of FCR, adding\r\nOLE or OPE to growing rabbit diets enhanced FCR linearly\r\n(P<0.05) during the period of the trial compared to the\r\ncontrol group. The addition of OPE improved FCR more\r\nthan the addition of OLE. At the overall ages of the rabbits,\r\nthe results of the performance index (PI percent) and\r\nrelative growth rate (RGR percent) demonstrated\r\nsignificant (P<0.05) differences across the dietary\r\ntreatments. In comparison to the control, adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the rabbits\' diets enhanced PI and RGR\r\nconsiderably. The rabbits fed on OPE1-enriched diet had\r\nthe highest PI and RGR with values 69.31 and 113.12,\r\nrespectively. In terms of PI and RGR, there were no\r\nsignificant changes between OLE and OPE.\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nTable 3 shows the effect of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on the digestibility coefficients and nutritional\r\nvalues of growing rabbits. The addition of OLE or OPE had\r\nno effect on the digestibility coefficients of CF, EE, or\r\nNFE. The addition of OLE or OPE raised the digestibility\r\ncoefficient of CP substantially (P<0.05). The groups fed\r\nOLE2 and OPE2 had the best digestibility coefficients for\r\nDM, OM and CP. When compared to the control, the\r\naddition of OLE or OPE significantly (P<0.05) enhanced\r\ntotal digestible nutrients (TDN), digestible energy (DE),\r\nand digestible crude protein (DCP).\r\nCarcass Characteristics\r\nTable 4 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\ncarcass traits. The addition of OLE or OLP enhanced\r\nsignificantly (P<0.05) carcass percent. The groups\r\nsupplemented with OLE2 or OPE2 had the highest carcass\r\npercent. The proportion of live body weight of the liver,\r\nheart, kidney, giblets, and spleen did not change because of\r\nthe varied additions. The control group had the greatest\r\nGIT percent, and dietary treatments supplementation with\r\ndifferent levels of extracts significantly (P<0.05) reduced\r\nGIT weight as a proportion of live body weight.\r\nAntioxidant Status\r\nTable 5 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\nrabbit antioxidant enzymes. When compared to the control\r\ngroup, the addition of olive leaves extract or olive pomace\r\nextract at 200 and 400ppm significantly improved total\r\nantioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD),\r\nand catalase (CAT). MDA, on the other hand, was\r\nconsiderably (P<0.05) reduced when OLE or OPE were\r\nadded.\r\nThyroid Hormones\r\nThe results of thyroid hormones were found in\r\ngrowing rabbits, as shown in Fig. 1. The addition of olive\r\nleaves extract or olive pomace extract to growing rabbit\r\ndiets at 200 or 400 ppm had no effect on T3, T4, or T4/T3\r\nin any of the groups.\r\nCaecum Fermentation Activities\r\nFig. 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and olive\r\npomace extracts on caecum total volatile fatty acids\r\n(TVFAs), ammonia nitrogen and pH. The addition of OLE\r\nor OPE had a significant (P<0.05) influence on caecum\r\nTVFAs and ammonia concentrations. The TVFA values for\r\nthe treatment groups varied from 4.16 to 4.14 (ml\r\neq/100mL) compared to 3.85 for the control group.\r\nTreatment ammonia concentrations were from 8.49 to 8.32\r\nmg/100mL, compared to 9.76mg/100 ml for the control.\r\nThe pH levels were unaffected and varied from 5.80 to 5.57\r\nfor the treatment groups compared to 5.97 for the control\r\ngroup.\r\nEconomic Efficiency\r\nTable 6 shows the impact of dietary treatments on\r\neconomic efficiency (EE) and relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE). The results showed that adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the diet of rabbits improved their relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE) compared to the control group. When\r\ncompared to the control diet, REE levels increased by\r\n13.56 and 18.64 percent with OLE1 and OLE2, and by\r\n25.42 and 19.49 percent with OPE1 and OPE2 for rabbit\r\ndiets, respectively.', 'Performance Parameters\r\nResults finding are confirmed by Oke et al. (2017),\r\nwho detected that supplementing olive leaves extract in the\r\ndrinking water of broiler chicks enhanced final body\r\nweight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio linearly\r\n(P<0.05). The induction of antimicrobial activity with olive\r\nleaves extract components may be linked to growth\r\nperformance improvements of broilers fed with OLE in\r\ndrinking water (10mL/L) (Jabri et al. 2017). Furthermore,\r\nthe enhanced performance rate of rabbits given olive leaves extract might be attributable to the antioxidant,\r\nantibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral\r\ncharacteristics of olive leaves extract (Aliabadi et al. 2012).\r\nAccording to Shafey et al. (2013), adding olive leaves\r\nextract (0, 1.8, 3.6, and 6.25g/kg) to broiler diets had no\r\neffect on feed consumption. According to Bahsi et al.\r\n(2016), adding 400 ppm of oleuropein to Japanese quail\r\nmeal boosted feed conversion ratio considerably. Ahmed et\r\nal. (2017) found that feeding laying hens 50, 100, or 150mg\r\nof oleuropein/kg diet enhanced egg production, egg mass,\r\nand feed conversion ratio considerably. Héla et al. (2019)\r\nfound that adding olive leaves aqueous extract to the\r\ndrinking water of developing rabbits at a concentration of\r\n20ml/L boosted daily body weight growth and feed\r\nconversion ratio linearly (P<0.05). The inclusion of 750\r\nppm of an olive pomace extract containing 10% total\r\ntriterpenes and 2% polyphenols considerably increased\r\nbroiler chick development performance (Herrero-Encinas\r\net al 2020). When OLE (75, 150, 300 and 600mg/kg) was\r\nadded to broiler chicken diets, body weight gain, carcass\r\nweight, and feed conversion ratio were improved (P<0.05)\r\nlinearly (Erener et al. 2020). The results of current study\r\nfound that enhanced growth performance in rabbits given\r\nOLE or OPE might be linked to FCR, digestive enzyme\r\nactivity, and nutrient absorption improvement, as well as\r\ncontrolling the gut microbiota, these findings also agreed\r\nwith the findings of Zeng et al. (2015).\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nThe inclusion of OLE2 and OPE2 resulted in the\r\ngreatest improvement in TDN, DCP, and DE percent. In\r\nterms of TDN, DCP, and DE percent, there were no\r\nsignificance differences between OLE1 and control.\r\nBroiler diets which contain olive leaves extracts, enhancing growth performance and feed efficiency due to the\r\nimprovement in nutritional digestibility, digestive enzyme\r\nactivation, and intestinal morphology (Leskovec et al.\r\n2018). This improvement might be attributed to a decrease\r\nin digesta viscosity, which boosts nutrient and enzyme\r\ndiffusion rates, allowing the animal to digest and absorb\r\nmore nutrients, resulting in improved intestinal health\r\n(Morrison et al. 2017). Furthermore, phenolic compounds\r\nin olive leaves can act as antioxidants and antibacterial,\r\nresulting in the growth of beneficial microflora and the\r\ndegradation of harmful or pathogenic microflora in the\r\ndigestive tract and caecum, resulting in improved nutrient\r\ndigestibility (Korukluoglu et al. 2010; Hamad 2015; Sarica\r\nand Ürkmez 2016; Thielmann et al. 2017; Elsherif et al. 2021).', 'These results suggested that including 200 and\r\n400ppm of olive leaves or olive pomace extracts into the\r\ndiet of growing rabbits might increase growth, carcass\r\ncharacteristics, antioxidant status, and economic efficiency\r\nwithout any negative effect on their health', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'Abaza L, Taamalli A, Nsir H and Zarrouk M, 2015.

This study aimed to\r\ninvestigate alterations in serum biochemical, mineral status and hematologic value in lactating ewes and does\r\ncompared with non-lactating animals under same condition (climate, feeding and rearing system). Significant\r\nreduction in RBCs, HB, and PCV% along with significant increase in MCV were the most consistent hematologic\r\nalterations. Significant reduction in protein and lipid profile along with increase in BUN was the most consistent\r\nbiochemical alteration. The minerals profile showed decrease in Zinc, Copper and Calcium, though PH\r\nshowed no\r\nchange. In Conclusion, this study showed that the lactation has significant effect on body metabolites, hematologic\r\nand mineral storage in small ruminant, for future production scheme, failure to substitute those deficit, will have a bad\r\nimpact on health and metabolism of animal production lifespan.', '0000-00-00', '0000-00-00', '0000-00-00', '0000-00-00', 'The author would like to express gratitude to Prof Fayez Salib and Dr Mohamed A Elkhiat for their help in samples collection', 'Lactation, Ewe, Doe, Hemato-biochemical, Mineral', '10.47278/journal.ijvs/2022.142', 'r80anas@gmail.com', 'A metabolic disorder affects the body\'s ability to digest and distribute macronutrients including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates . Metabolic disorders occur when the body\'s normal metabolic process is disrupted by abnormal chemical reactions. It can also be characterized as a hereditary single gene aberration, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (Zheng et al. 2021). Physical inactivity, cigarette smoking and an elevated BMI are all\r\nlifestyle risk factors. Other causes include hypertension, poor glucose metabolism and high blood pressure and\r\ncholesterol concentration contribute to these disorders (Akhuemonkhan and Lazo 2017). Lethargy, weight loss, jaundice, and seizures are some of the signs of metabolic diseases. Symptoms would differ depending on the type of metabolic disease. Acute symptoms, late-onset acute\r\nsymptoms, gradual general symptoms, and persistent symptoms are the four types of symptoms (Agana et al. 2018; Mendrick et al. 2018). Inherited metabolic diseases\r\nare a type of metabolic disorder caused by a faulty gene that results in an enzyme deficit. Inborn errors of metabolism are a group of disorders with a variety of subtypes. When the liver or pancreas does not function properly, metabolic disorders might develop. Fig. 1 represented some types of metabolic disorders (Hernández-Granados et al. 2018). Any sickness or disorder that affects the human reproductive system is referred to as reproductive disorders.\r\nImproper hormone yielding via ovaries or testes, as well as other endocrine glands is among them . Genetic or congenital\r\ndefects, infections, tumors, or disorders of unknown sources can all cause these diseases (Hutson et al. 2014) .\r\nGenetic abnormalities, genital anomalies, infections,\r\nstructural differences, and cancers are the primary divisions of these disorders (Rawal and Austin 2015; Elshazly et al.\r\n2019). Symptoms of reproductive disorders are bleeding in between periods and within it, itching, burning of the\r\ngenital area, and pain during sex, severe pelvic/abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination (Hutson et\r\nal. 2014). Common reproductive conditions for human females are anomalies of the clitoris, vagina and uterus,\r\nabnormalities of menstrual cycle endometriosis, cancers, polycystic ovarian syndrome and diseases as AIDS,\r\nsyphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital herpes. And in men are pseudo hermaphroditism, anomalies of the penis,\r\nurethra, testes, prostate gland and seminal vesicles, Impotence, benign prostatic hyperplasia, Priapism,\r\ntesticular cancer and prostate disease. Intersexuality syndrome as Klinefelter, Turner, and testicular feminization. Delayed and precocious puberty in both\r\n(Rawal and Austin 2015). Infertility is one of the most serious issues that is worsening by the day and endangering\r\nthe human generation\'s future. Varicocele reduces sperm morphology and improves sperm count in people with aberrant morphology. Ovarian, cervical and prostate cancers are the deadliest of reproductive cancers. Some risk\r\nfactors for this malignancy include age, history of family and late menopause. While pregnant and breastfeeding, the\r\nlikelihood of occurrence is reduced (Salehi et al. 2008). There is a relation between metabolic and reproductive\r\ndisorders as diabetic complications can lead to some reproductive disorder as subfertility, delayed puberty or\r\ndisturbance in the menstrual cycle. Reproductive difficulties can appear early in adolescence, later, or during\r\nthe climacteric period, relying on the age at which diabetes is discovered. Decreased concentrations of LH, FSH and\r\nestradiol occurred in type 2 human studies (Gnanadass et al. 2021).\r\nBecause of central hypogonadism, women with type 1 diabetes sometimes have amenorrhoea, polycystic ovarian\r\nsyndrome and hyperandrogenism, and infertility that can be controlled by insulin administration and improved\r\nmetabolic disorder (Codner et al. 2012). Also, type 2 diabetes is related to other reproductive disorders like obesity and insulin resistance related to polycystic ovarian syndrome due to improper lifestyle. Although pubertal breast development appears to be delayed in type 1 diabetes, some people with type 1 diabetes still experience a small delay in menarche due to diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy (Calcaterra et al. 2021). The most common menstrual cycle abnormalities are oligomenorrhoea and\r\nprolonged cycle length that are related to patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, studies revealed that these disturbances\r\nare more than six times than normal women without diabetes. Disturbance in BMI, sex steroid and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations is also related to\r\ntype 2 diabetes (Thong et al. 2021).', 'Study Ethical Approval\r\nThe authors confirm that the ethical policies of the\r\njournal have been adhered to and the appropriate ethical\r\nreview committee approval has been received. The authors\r\nfollowed EU standards for the protection of animals used\r\nfor scientific purposes. The experimental work was\r\nconducted at Sakha Research Station in Kafrelsheikh\r\nGovernorate, Animal Production Research Institute,\r\nAgricultural Research Center, the Ministry of Agriculture,\r\nEgypt. The laboratory part conducted at laboratories of\r\nNational Research Centre, Animal Production Department,\r\nEgypt, and By-Products Research Department, Animal\r\nProduction Research Institute, Agricultural Research\r\nCenter, Egypt.\r\nExtracts of Olive Leaves and Olive Pomace\r\nOlive leaves and pomace were extracted using 65\r\npercent ethanol with vigorous stirring for three hours\r\nadopting a heat reflux extraction procedure. The extract\r\nwas then separated at 40°C using a rotary evaporator\r\n(Loghmanifar et al. 2020; Elsherif et al. 2021). Finally,\r\nCalcium carbonate was added as a carrier material to load\r\nthe extracts separately, giving them the ability to use and\r\nmix with feed ingredients.\r\nExperimental Diets\r\nAccording to Agriculture Ministry Decree, 1996\r\nrequirements, the control diet was formed to meet all the\r\nnutritional needs of growing rabbits. Control (without\r\nadditives), OLE1 (Olive leaves extract, 200ppm), OLE2\r\n(olive leaves extract, 400ppm), OPE1 (olive pomace\r\nextract, 200ppm) and OPE2 (olive pomace extract,\r\n400ppm) were the five treatments. The experiment lasted\r\n56 days (from 42-98 days of age). Table 1 shows the\r\ncomposition of the control diet as well as the computed\r\nanalyses.\r\nAnimals and Management\r\nSeventy-five APRI growing rabbits were divided into\r\nfive groups of 15 rabbits each at 42 days of age (624g\r\naverage body weight). Rabbits were kept in battery cages\r\nwith separate feeding units. Water and diets were available\r\nad libitum. All the rabbits were kept in the same sanitary\r\nand managerial settings. Weekly feed intake and live body\r\nweight were recorded and the feed efficiency and body\r\nweight gained were computed.\r\nDigestibility Trail\r\nAt the end of this experiment, seven rabbits from each\r\ngroup were used in a digestibility test. Feces were collected\r\ndaily, weighed, dried at 60°C for 24 hours, roughly\r\npowdered, and stored for AOAC, 2000 chemical analysis.\r\nAccording to Pérez et al. (1995), the coefficients of\r\ndigestion and nutritional values of the dietary treatments\r\nwere calculated using data from amounts and chemical\r\nanalyses of feed and feces.\r\nCarcass Characteristics and Blood Samples\r\nFive rabbits from each treatment were starved for 24\r\nhours and slaughtered for carcass and internal organs at the\r\nend of the experiment. The percentages of carcass and\r\norgans as a percentage of live weights were calculated.\r\nBlood samples were taken from the slaughtered rabbits as\r\nwell.\r\nAnalyses of Antioxidants Status\r\nBlood serum samples were separated by centrifugation\r\nat 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, then stored at -20°C until\r\nchemical analysis. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and\r\nmalondialdehyde (MDA) levels in blood serum were\r\nexamined. The livers were also obtained for the\r\nmeasurement of hepatic CAT, SOD, and GSH antioxidant\r\nenzymes in an automated calibration spectrophotometer\r\nwith high-performance readings (bio diagnostic, Cairo,\r\nEgypt) (FlexorEL200 Biochemical Analyzer).\r\nThyroid Hormone Concentration\r\nTotal T3 and T4 levels in the blood were measured\r\nusing commercial ELISA kits (MyBioSource, Inc., San\r\nDiego, CA). By dividing the T3 value by the T4 value, the\r\nT3/T4 ratio was computed.\r\nCecum pH, Ammonia Nitrogen Concentration and\r\nTotal Volatile Fatty Acids\r\nCecum contents samples were taken from slaughtered\r\nrabbits and utilized to measure cecum pH using a digital pH\r\nmeter immediately. Conway (1958) technique was used to\r\ndetermine the ammonia nitrogen concentration. According\r\nto Eadie et al. (1967), the total volatile fatty acids in caecum were determined using steam distillation unit.\r\nEconomic Efficiency At the end of the trial period, the economic efficiency profit of rabbit production were calculated using the following formula:\r\n➢ (Total feed cost + additives cost) Equals total cost per rabbit.\r\n➢ (Body weight gain (kg) x selling price of kg rabbit) Equals total return per rabbit (Egyptian pound, L.E).\r\n➢ Total return per rabbit - total cost per rabbit equals net return per rabbit (L.E.).\r\n➢ Net return per rabbit divided by total cost per rabbit equals economic efficiency (L.E.).\r\n➢ Economic efficiency of each treatment calculated for each one with multiplying by 100 (control economic efficiency).\r\n\r\n', 'Performance Parameters\r\nTable 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on body weight (bwt), weight gain (WG), feed\r\nintake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in growing\r\nrabbits. The results revealed that adding 200ppm (OLE1,\r\nOPE1) or 400ppm (OLE2, OPE2) of olive leaves extract or\r\nolive pomace extract raised the final bwt linearly (P<0.05).\r\nIn comparison to the control diet, which had a final body\r\nweight of 2011g, OPE1 had the highest value (2175g).\r\nThere were no significant variations in bwt between the\r\ngroups given OLE or OPE at the two levels tested. The\r\naddition of OLE or OPE greatly improved WG at all ages,\r\nand the results of WG followed the same trend as bwt. OPE\r\nhad a better effect on WG than OLE, although there were\r\nno significant differences between them. The feed intake of\r\nrabbits fed varied amounts of OLE or OPE in their diets\r\nwas unaffected linearly (P<0.05). In terms of FCR, adding\r\nOLE or OPE to growing rabbit diets enhanced FCR linearly\r\n(P<0.05) during the period of the trial compared to the\r\ncontrol group. The addition of OPE improved FCR more\r\nthan the addition of OLE. At the overall ages of the rabbits,\r\nthe results of the performance index (PI percent) and\r\nrelative growth rate (RGR percent) demonstrated\r\nsignificant (P<0.05) differences across the dietary\r\ntreatments. In comparison to the control, adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the rabbits\' diets enhanced PI and RGR\r\nconsiderably. The rabbits fed on OPE1-enriched diet had\r\nthe highest PI and RGR with values 69.31 and 113.12,\r\nrespectively. In terms of PI and RGR, there were no\r\nsignificant changes between OLE and OPE.\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nTable 3 shows the effect of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on the digestibility coefficients and nutritional\r\nvalues of growing rabbits. The addition of OLE or OPE had\r\nno effect on the digestibility coefficients of CF, EE, or\r\nNFE. The addition of OLE or OPE raised the digestibility\r\ncoefficient of CP substantially (P<0.05). The groups fed\r\nOLE2 and OPE2 had the best digestibility coefficients for\r\nDM, OM and CP. When compared to the control, the\r\naddition of OLE or OPE significantly (P<0.05) enhanced\r\ntotal digestible nutrients (TDN), digestible energy (DE),\r\nand digestible crude protein (DCP).\r\nCarcass Characteristics\r\nTable 4 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\ncarcass traits. The addition of OLE or OLP enhanced\r\nsignificantly (P<0.05) carcass percent. The groups\r\nsupplemented with OLE2 or OPE2 had the highest carcass\r\npercent. The proportion of live body weight of the liver,\r\nheart, kidney, giblets, and spleen did not change because of\r\nthe varied additions. The control group had the greatest\r\nGIT percent, and dietary treatments supplementation with\r\ndifferent levels of extracts significantly (P<0.05) reduced\r\nGIT weight as a proportion of live body weight.\r\nAntioxidant Status\r\nTable 5 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\nrabbit antioxidant enzymes. When compared to the control\r\ngroup, the addition of olive leaves extract or olive pomace\r\nextract at 200 and 400ppm significantly improved total\r\nantioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD),\r\nand catalase (CAT). MDA, on the other hand, was\r\nconsiderably (P<0.05) reduced when OLE or OPE were\r\nadded.\r\nThyroid Hormones\r\nThe results of thyroid hormones were found in\r\ngrowing rabbits, as shown in Fig. 1. The addition of olive\r\nleaves extract or olive pomace extract to growing rabbit\r\ndiets at 200 or 400 ppm had no effect on T3, T4, or T4/T3\r\nin any of the groups.\r\nCaecum Fermentation Activities\r\nFig. 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and olive\r\npomace extracts on caecum total volatile fatty acids\r\n(TVFAs), ammonia nitrogen and pH. The addition of OLE\r\nor OPE had a significant (P<0.05) influence on caecum\r\nTVFAs and ammonia concentrations. The TVFA values for\r\nthe treatment groups varied from 4.16 to 4.14 (ml\r\neq/100mL) compared to 3.85 for the control group.\r\nTreatment ammonia concentrations were from 8.49 to 8.32\r\nmg/100mL, compared to 9.76mg/100 ml for the control.\r\nThe pH levels were unaffected and varied from 5.80 to 5.57\r\nfor the treatment groups compared to 5.97 for the control\r\ngroup.\r\nEconomic Efficiency\r\nTable 6 shows the impact of dietary treatments on\r\neconomic efficiency (EE) and relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE). The results showed that adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the diet of rabbits improved their relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE) compared to the control group. When\r\ncompared to the control diet, REE levels increased by\r\n13.56 and 18.64 percent with OLE1 and OLE2, and by\r\n25.42 and 19.49 percent with OPE1 and OPE2 for rabbit\r\ndiets, respectively.', 'Performance Parameters\r\nResults finding are confirmed by Oke et al. (2017),\r\nwho detected that supplementing olive leaves extract in the\r\ndrinking water of broiler chicks enhanced final body\r\nweight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio linearly\r\n(P<0.05). The induction of antimicrobial activity with olive\r\nleaves extract components may be linked to growth\r\nperformance improvements of broilers fed with OLE in\r\ndrinking water (10mL/L) (Jabri et al. 2017). Furthermore,\r\nthe enhanced performance rate of rabbits given olive leaves extract might be attributable to the antioxidant,\r\nantibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral\r\ncharacteristics of olive leaves extract (Aliabadi et al. 2012).\r\nAccording to Shafey et al. (2013), adding olive leaves\r\nextract (0, 1.8, 3.6, and 6.25g/kg) to broiler diets had no\r\neffect on feed consumption. According to Bahsi et al.\r\n(2016), adding 400 ppm of oleuropein to Japanese quail\r\nmeal boosted feed conversion ratio considerably. Ahmed et\r\nal. (2017) found that feeding laying hens 50, 100, or 150mg\r\nof oleuropein/kg diet enhanced egg production, egg mass,\r\nand feed conversion ratio considerably. Héla et al. (2019)\r\nfound that adding olive leaves aqueous extract to the\r\ndrinking water of developing rabbits at a concentration of\r\n20ml/L boosted daily body weight growth and feed\r\nconversion ratio linearly (P<0.05). The inclusion of 750\r\nppm of an olive pomace extract containing 10% total\r\ntriterpenes and 2% polyphenols considerably increased\r\nbroiler chick development performance (Herrero-Encinas\r\net al 2020). When OLE (75, 150, 300 and 600mg/kg) was\r\nadded to broiler chicken diets, body weight gain, carcass\r\nweight, and feed conversion ratio were improved (P<0.05)\r\nlinearly (Erener et al. 2020). The results of current study\r\nfound that enhanced growth performance in rabbits given\r\nOLE or OPE might be linked to FCR, digestive enzyme\r\nactivity, and nutrient absorption improvement, as well as\r\ncontrolling the gut microbiota, these findings also agreed\r\nwith the findings of Zeng et al. (2015).\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nThe inclusion of OLE2 and OPE2 resulted in the\r\ngreatest improvement in TDN, DCP, and DE percent. In\r\nterms of TDN, DCP, and DE percent, there were no\r\nsignificance differences between OLE1 and control.\r\nBroiler diets which contain olive leaves extracts, enhancing growth performance and feed efficiency due to the\r\nimprovement in nutritional digestibility, digestive enzyme\r\nactivation, and intestinal morphology (Leskovec et al.\r\n2018). This improvement might be attributed to a decrease\r\nin digesta viscosity, which boosts nutrient and enzyme\r\ndiffusion rates, allowing the animal to digest and absorb\r\nmore nutrients, resulting in improved intestinal health\r\n(Morrison et al. 2017). Furthermore, phenolic compounds\r\nin olive leaves can act as antioxidants and antibacterial,\r\nresulting in the growth of beneficial microflora and the\r\ndegradation of harmful or pathogenic microflora in the\r\ndigestive tract and caecum, resulting in improved nutrient\r\ndigestibility (Korukluoglu et al. 2010; Hamad 2015; Sarica\r\nand Ürkmez 2016; Thielmann et al. 2017; Elsherif et al. 2021).', 'These results suggested that including 200 and\r\n400ppm of olive leaves or olive pomace extracts into the\r\ndiet of growing rabbits might increase growth, carcass\r\ncharacteristics, antioxidant status, and economic efficiency\r\nwithout any negative effect on their health', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'Abaza L, Taamalli A, Nsir H and Zarrouk M, 2015.

This study aimed to\r\ninvestigate alterations in serum biochemical, mineral status and hematologic value in lactating ewes and does\r\ncompared with non-lactating animals under same condition (climate, feeding and rearing system). Significant\r\nreduction in RBCs, HB, and PCV% along with significant increase in MCV were the most consistent hematologic\r\nalterations. Significant reduction in protein and lipid profile along with increase in BUN was the most consistent\r\nbiochemical alteration. The minerals profile showed decrease in Zinc, Copper and Calcium, though PH\r\nshowed no\r\nchange. In Conclusion, this study showed that the lactation has significant effect on body metabolites, hematologic\r\nand mineral storage in small ruminant, for future production scheme, failure to substitute those deficit, will have a bad\r\nimpact on health and metabolism of animal production lifespan.', '0000-00-00', '0000-00-00', '0000-00-00', '0000-00-00', 'The author would like to express gratitude to Prof Fayez Salib and Dr Mohamed A Elkhiat for their help in samples collection', 'Lactation, Ewe, Doe, Hemato-biochemical, Mineral', '10.47278/journal.ijvs/2022.142', 'r80anas@gmail.com', 'A metabolic disorder affects the body\'s ability to digest and distribute macronutrients including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates . Metabolic disorders occur when the body\'s normal metabolic process is disrupted by abnormal chemical reactions. It can also be characterized as a hereditary single gene aberration, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (Zheng et al. 2021). Physical inactivity, cigarette smoking and an elevated BMI are all\r\nlifestyle risk factors. Other causes include hypertension, poor glucose metabolism and high blood pressure and\r\ncholesterol concentration contribute to these disorders (Akhuemonkhan and Lazo 2017). Lethargy, weight loss, jaundice, and seizures are some of the signs of metabolic diseases. Symptoms would differ depending on the type of metabolic disease. Acute symptoms, late-onset acute\r\nsymptoms, gradual general symptoms, and persistent symptoms are the four types of symptoms (Agana et al. 2018; Mendrick et al. 2018). Inherited metabolic diseases\r\nare a type of metabolic disorder caused by a faulty gene that results in an enzyme deficit. Inborn errors of metabolism are a group of disorders with a variety of subtypes. When the liver or pancreas does not function properly, metabolic disorders might develop. Fig. 1 represented some types of metabolic disorders (Hernández-Granados et al. 2018). Any sickness or disorder that affects the human reproductive system is referred to as reproductive disorders.\r\nImproper hormone yielding via ovaries or testes, as well as other endocrine glands is among them . Genetic or congenital\r\ndefects, infections, tumors, or disorders of unknown sources can all cause these diseases (Hutson et al. 2014) .\r\nGenetic abnormalities, genital anomalies, infections,\r\nstructural differences, and cancers are the primary divisions of these disorders (Rawal and Austin 2015; Elshazly et al.\r\n2019). Symptoms of reproductive disorders are bleeding in between periods and within it, itching, burning of the\r\ngenital area, and pain during sex, severe pelvic/abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination (Hutson et\r\nal. 2014). Common reproductive conditions for human females are anomalies of the clitoris, vagina and uterus,\r\nabnormalities of menstrual cycle endometriosis, cancers, polycystic ovarian syndrome and diseases as AIDS,\r\nsyphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital herpes. And in men are pseudo hermaphroditism, anomalies of the penis,\r\nurethra, testes, prostate gland and seminal vesicles, Impotence, benign prostatic hyperplasia, Priapism,\r\ntesticular cancer and prostate disease. Intersexuality syndrome as Klinefelter, Turner, and testicular feminization. Delayed and precocious puberty in both\r\n(Rawal and Austin 2015). Infertility is one of the most serious issues that is worsening by the day and endangering\r\nthe human generation\'s future. Varicocele reduces sperm morphology and improves sperm count in people with aberrant morphology. Ovarian, cervical and prostate cancers are the deadliest of reproductive cancers. Some risk\r\nfactors for this malignancy include age, history of family and late menopause. While pregnant and breastfeeding, the\r\nlikelihood of occurrence is reduced (Salehi et al. 2008). There is a relation between metabolic and reproductive\r\ndisorders as diabetic complications can lead to some reproductive disorder as subfertility, delayed puberty or\r\ndisturbance in the menstrual cycle. Reproductive difficulties can appear early in adolescence, later, or during\r\nthe climacteric period, relying on the age at which diabetes is discovered. Decreased concentrations of LH, FSH and\r\nestradiol occurred in type 2 human studies (Gnanadass et al. 2021).\r\nBecause of central hypogonadism, women with type 1 diabetes sometimes have amenorrhoea, polycystic ovarian\r\nsyndrome and hyperandrogenism, and infertility that can be controlled by insulin administration and improved\r\nmetabolic disorder (Codner et al. 2012). Also, type 2 diabetes is related to other reproductive disorders like obesity and insulin resistance related to polycystic ovarian syndrome due to improper lifestyle. Although pubertal breast development appears to be delayed in type 1 diabetes, some people with type 1 diabetes still experience a small delay in menarche due to diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy (Calcaterra et al. 2021). The most common menstrual cycle abnormalities are oligomenorrhoea and\r\nprolonged cycle length that are related to patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, studies revealed that these disturbances\r\nare more than six times than normal women without diabetes. Disturbance in BMI, sex steroid and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations is also related to\r\ntype 2 diabetes (Thong et al. 2021).', 'Study Ethical Approval\r\nThe authors confirm that the ethical policies of the\r\njournal have been adhered to and the appropriate ethical\r\nreview committee approval has been received. The authors\r\nfollowed EU standards for the protection of animals used\r\nfor scientific purposes. The experimental work was\r\nconducted at Sakha Research Station in Kafrelsheikh\r\nGovernorate, Animal Production Research Institute,\r\nAgricultural Research Center, the Ministry of Agriculture,\r\nEgypt. The laboratory part conducted at laboratories of\r\nNational Research Centre, Animal Production Department,\r\nEgypt, and By-Products Research Department, Animal\r\nProduction Research Institute, Agricultural Research\r\nCenter, Egypt.\r\nExtracts of Olive Leaves and Olive Pomace\r\nOlive leaves and pomace were extracted using 65\r\npercent ethanol with vigorous stirring for three hours\r\nadopting a heat reflux extraction procedure. The extract\r\nwas then separated at 40°C using a rotary evaporator\r\n(Loghmanifar et al. 2020; Elsherif et al. 2021). Finally,\r\nCalcium carbonate was added as a carrier material to load\r\nthe extracts separately, giving them the ability to use and\r\nmix with feed ingredients.\r\nExperimental Diets\r\nAccording to Agriculture Ministry Decree, 1996\r\nrequirements, the control diet was formed to meet all the\r\nnutritional needs of growing rabbits. Control (without\r\nadditives), OLE1 (Olive leaves extract, 200ppm), OLE2\r\n(olive leaves extract, 400ppm), OPE1 (olive pomace\r\nextract, 200ppm) and OPE2 (olive pomace extract,\r\n400ppm) were the five treatments. The experiment lasted\r\n56 days (from 42-98 days of age). Table 1 shows the\r\ncomposition of the control diet as well as the computed\r\nanalyses.\r\nAnimals and Management\r\nSeventy-five APRI growing rabbits were divided into\r\nfive groups of 15 rabbits each at 42 days of age (624g\r\naverage body weight). Rabbits were kept in battery cages\r\nwith separate feeding units. Water and diets were available\r\nad libitum. All the rabbits were kept in the same sanitary\r\nand managerial settings. Weekly feed intake and live body\r\nweight were recorded and the feed efficiency and body\r\nweight gained were computed.\r\nDigestibility Trail\r\nAt the end of this experiment, seven rabbits from each\r\ngroup were used in a digestibility test. Feces were collected\r\ndaily, weighed, dried at 60°C for 24 hours, roughly\r\npowdered, and stored for AOAC, 2000 chemical analysis.\r\nAccording to Pérez et al. (1995), the coefficients of\r\ndigestion and nutritional values of the dietary treatments\r\nwere calculated using data from amounts and chemical\r\nanalyses of feed and feces.\r\nCarcass Characteristics and Blood Samples\r\nFive rabbits from each treatment were starved for 24\r\nhours and slaughtered for carcass and internal organs at the\r\nend of the experiment. The percentages of carcass and\r\norgans as a percentage of live weights were calculated.\r\nBlood samples were taken from the slaughtered rabbits as\r\nwell.\r\nAnalyses of Antioxidants Status\r\nBlood serum samples were separated by centrifugation\r\nat 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, then stored at -20°C until\r\nchemical analysis. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and\r\nmalondialdehyde (MDA) levels in blood serum were\r\nexamined. The livers were also obtained for the\r\nmeasurement of hepatic CAT, SOD, and GSH antioxidant\r\nenzymes in an automated calibration spectrophotometer\r\nwith high-performance readings (bio diagnostic, Cairo,\r\nEgypt) (FlexorEL200 Biochemical Analyzer).\r\nThyroid Hormone Concentration\r\nTotal T3 and T4 levels in the blood were measured\r\nusing commercial ELISA kits (MyBioSource, Inc., San\r\nDiego, CA). By dividing the T3 value by the T4 value, the\r\nT3/T4 ratio was computed.\r\nCecum pH, Ammonia Nitrogen Concentration and\r\nTotal Volatile Fatty Acids\r\nCecum contents samples were taken from slaughtered\r\nrabbits and utilized to measure cecum pH using a digital pH\r\nmeter immediately. Conway (1958) technique was used to\r\ndetermine the ammonia nitrogen concentration. According\r\nto Eadie et al. (1967), the total volatile fatty acids in caecum were determined using steam distillation unit.\r\nEconomic Efficiency At the end of the trial period, the economic efficiency profit of rabbit production were calculated using the following formula:\r\n➢ (Total feed cost + additives cost) Equals total cost per rabbit.\r\n➢ (Body weight gain (kg) x selling price of kg rabbit) Equals total return per rabbit (Egyptian pound, L.E).\r\n➢ Total return per rabbit - total cost per rabbit equals net return per rabbit (L.E.).\r\n➢ Net return per rabbit divided by total cost per rabbit equals economic efficiency (L.E.).\r\n➢ Economic efficiency of each treatment calculated for each one with multiplying by 100 (control economic efficiency).\r\n\r\n', 'Performance Parameters\r\nTable 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on body weight (bwt), weight gain (WG), feed\r\nintake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in growing\r\nrabbits. The results revealed that adding 200ppm (OLE1,\r\nOPE1) or 400ppm (OLE2, OPE2) of olive leaves extract or\r\nolive pomace extract raised the final bwt linearly (P<0.05).\r\nIn comparison to the control diet, which had a final body\r\nweight of 2011g, OPE1 had the highest value (2175g).\r\nThere were no significant variations in bwt between the\r\ngroups given OLE or OPE at the two levels tested. The\r\naddition of OLE or OPE greatly improved WG at all ages,\r\nand the results of WG followed the same trend as bwt. OPE\r\nhad a better effect on WG than OLE, although there were\r\nno significant differences between them. The feed intake of\r\nrabbits fed varied amounts of OLE or OPE in their diets\r\nwas unaffected linearly (P<0.05). In terms of FCR, adding\r\nOLE or OPE to growing rabbit diets enhanced FCR linearly\r\n(P<0.05) during the period of the trial compared to the\r\ncontrol group. The addition of OPE improved FCR more\r\nthan the addition of OLE. At the overall ages of the rabbits,\r\nthe results of the performance index (PI percent) and\r\nrelative growth rate (RGR percent) demonstrated\r\nsignificant (P<0.05) differences across the dietary\r\ntreatments. In comparison to the control, adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the rabbits\' diets enhanced PI and RGR\r\nconsiderably. The rabbits fed on OPE1-enriched diet had\r\nthe highest PI and RGR with values 69.31 and 113.12,\r\nrespectively. In terms of PI and RGR, there were no\r\nsignificant changes between OLE and OPE.\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nTable 3 shows the effect of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on the digestibility coefficients and nutritional\r\nvalues of growing rabbits. The addition of OLE or OPE had\r\nno effect on the digestibility coefficients of CF, EE, or\r\nNFE. The addition of OLE or OPE raised the digestibility\r\ncoefficient of CP substantially (P<0.05). The groups fed\r\nOLE2 and OPE2 had the best digestibility coefficients for\r\nDM, OM and CP. When compared to the control, the\r\naddition of OLE or OPE significantly (P<0.05) enhanced\r\ntotal digestible nutrients (TDN), digestible energy (DE),\r\nand digestible crude protein (DCP).\r\nCarcass Characteristics\r\nTable 4 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\ncarcass traits. The addition of OLE or OLP enhanced\r\nsignificantly (P<0.05) carcass percent. The groups\r\nsupplemented with OLE2 or OPE2 had the highest carcass\r\npercent. The proportion of live body weight of the liver,\r\nheart, kidney, giblets, and spleen did not change because of\r\nthe varied additions. The control group had the greatest\r\nGIT percent, and dietary treatments supplementation with\r\ndifferent levels of extracts significantly (P<0.05) reduced\r\nGIT weight as a proportion of live body weight.\r\nAntioxidant Status\r\nTable 5 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\nrabbit antioxidant enzymes. When compared to the control\r\ngroup, the addition of olive leaves extract or olive pomace\r\nextract at 200 and 400ppm significantly improved total\r\nantioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD),\r\nand catalase (CAT). MDA, on the other hand, was\r\nconsiderably (P<0.05) reduced when OLE or OPE were\r\nadded.\r\nThyroid Hormones\r\nThe results of thyroid hormones were found in\r\ngrowing rabbits, as shown in Fig. 1. The addition of olive\r\nleaves extract or olive pomace extract to growing rabbit\r\ndiets at 200 or 400 ppm had no effect on T3, T4, or T4/T3\r\nin any of the groups.\r\nCaecum Fermentation Activities\r\nFig. 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and olive\r\npomace extracts on caecum total volatile fatty acids\r\n(TVFAs), ammonia nitrogen and pH. The addition of OLE\r\nor OPE had a significant (P<0.05) influence on caecum\r\nTVFAs and ammonia concentrations. The TVFA values for\r\nthe treatment groups varied from 4.16 to 4.14 (ml\r\neq/100mL) compared to 3.85 for the control group.\r\nTreatment ammonia concentrations were from 8.49 to 8.32\r\nmg/100mL, compared to 9.76mg/100 ml for the control.\r\nThe pH levels were unaffected and varied from 5.80 to 5.57\r\nfor the treatment groups compared to 5.97 for the control\r\ngroup.\r\nEconomic Efficiency\r\nTable 6 shows the impact of dietary treatments on\r\neconomic efficiency (EE) and relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE). The results showed that adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the diet of rabbits improved their relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE) compared to the control group. When\r\ncompared to the control diet, REE levels increased by\r\n13.56 and 18.64 percent with OLE1 and OLE2, and by\r\n25.42 and 19.49 percent with OPE1 and OPE2 for rabbit\r\ndiets, respectively.', 'Performance Parameters\r\nResults finding are confirmed by Oke et al. (2017),\r\nwho detected that supplementing olive leaves extract in the\r\ndrinking water of broiler chicks enhanced final body\r\nweight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio linearly\r\n(P<0.05). The induction of antimicrobial activity with olive\r\nleaves extract components may be linked to growth\r\nperformance improvements of broilers fed with OLE in\r\ndrinking water (10mL/L) (Jabri et al. 2017). Furthermore,\r\nthe enhanced performance rate of rabbits given olive leaves extract might be attributable to the antioxidant,\r\nantibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral\r\ncharacteristics of olive leaves extract (Aliabadi et al. 2012).\r\nAccording to Shafey et al. (2013), adding olive leaves\r\nextract (0, 1.8, 3.6, and 6.25g/kg) to broiler diets had no\r\neffect on feed consumption. According to Bahsi et al.\r\n(2016), adding 400 ppm of oleuropein to Japanese quail\r\nmeal boosted feed conversion ratio considerably. Ahmed et\r\nal. (2017) found that feeding laying hens 50, 100, or 150mg\r\nof oleuropein/kg diet enhanced egg production, egg mass,\r\nand feed conversion ratio considerably. Héla et al. (2019)\r\nfound that adding olive leaves aqueous extract to the\r\ndrinking water of developing rabbits at a concentration of\r\n20ml/L boosted daily body weight growth and feed\r\nconversion ratio linearly (P<0.05). The inclusion of 750\r\nppm of an olive pomace extract containing 10% total\r\ntriterpenes and 2% polyphenols considerably increased\r\nbroiler chick development performance (Herrero-Encinas\r\net al 2020). When OLE (75, 150, 300 and 600mg/kg) was\r\nadded to broiler chicken diets, body weight gain, carcass\r\nweight, and feed conversion ratio were improved (P<0.05)\r\nlinearly (Erener et al. 2020). The results of current study\r\nfound that enhanced growth performance in rabbits given\r\nOLE or OPE might be linked to FCR, digestive enzyme\r\nactivity, and nutrient absorption improvement, as well as\r\ncontrolling the gut microbiota, these findings also agreed\r\nwith the findings of Zeng et al. (2015).\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nThe inclusion of OLE2 and OPE2 resulted in the\r\ngreatest improvement in TDN, DCP, and DE percent. In\r\nterms of TDN, DCP, and DE percent, there were no\r\nsignificance differences between OLE1 and control.\r\nBroiler diets which contain olive leaves extracts, enhancing growth performance and feed efficiency due to the\r\nimprovement in nutritional digestibility, digestive enzyme\r\nactivation, and intestinal morphology (Leskovec et al.\r\n2018). This improvement might be attributed to a decrease\r\nin digesta viscosity, which boosts nutrient and enzyme\r\ndiffusion rates, allowing the animal to digest and absorb\r\nmore nutrients, resulting in improved intestinal health\r\n(Morrison et al. 2017). Furthermore, phenolic compounds\r\nin olive leaves can act as antioxidants and antibacterial,\r\nresulting in the growth of beneficial microflora and the\r\ndegradation of harmful or pathogenic microflora in the\r\ndigestive tract and caecum, resulting in improved nutrient\r\ndigestibility (Korukluoglu et al. 2010; Hamad 2015; Sarica\r\nand Ürkmez 2016; Thielmann et al. 2017; Elsherif et al. 2021).', 'These results suggested that including 200 and\r\n400ppm of olive leaves or olive pomace extracts into the\r\ndiet of growing rabbits might increase growth, carcass\r\ncharacteristics, antioxidant status, and economic efficiency\r\nwithout any negative effect on their health', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'Abaza L, Taamalli A, Nsir H and Zarrouk M, 2015.

Metabolic disorders occur when the body\'s normal metabolic process is disrupted by abnormal chemical reactions. It can also be characterized as a hereditary single gene aberration, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (Zheng et al. 2021). Physical inactivity, cigarette smoking and an elevated BMI are all\r\nlifestyle risk factors. Other causes include hypertension, poor glucose metabolism and high blood pressure and\r\ncholesterol concentration contribute to these disorders (Akhuemonkhan and Lazo 2017). Lethargy, weight loss, jaundice, and seizures are some of the signs of metabolic diseases. Symptoms would differ depending on the type of metabolic disease. Acute symptoms, late-onset acute\r\nsymptoms, gradual general symptoms, and persistent symptoms are the four types of symptoms (Agana et al. 2018; Mendrick et al. 2018). Inherited metabolic diseases\r\nare a type of metabolic disorder caused by a faulty gene that results in an enzyme deficit. Inborn errors of metabolism are a group of disorders with a variety of subtypes. When the liver or pancreas does not function properly, metabolic disorders might develop. Fig. 1 represented some types of metabolic disorders (Hernández-Granados et al. 2018). Any sickness or disorder that affects the human reproductive system is referred to as reproductive disorders.\r\nImproper hormone yielding via ovaries or testes, as well as other endocrine glands is among them . Genetic or congenital\r\ndefects, infections, tumors, or disorders of unknown sources can all cause these diseases (Hutson et al. 2014) .\r\nGenetic abnormalities, genital anomalies, infections,\r\nstructural differences, and cancers are the primary divisions of these disorders (Rawal and Austin 2015; Elshazly et al.\r\n2019). Symptoms of reproductive disorders are bleeding in between periods and within it, itching, burning of the\r\ngenital area, and pain during sex, severe pelvic/abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination (Hutson et\r\nal. 2014). Common reproductive conditions for human females are anomalies of the clitoris, vagina and uterus,\r\nabnormalities of menstrual cycle endometriosis, cancers, polycystic ovarian syndrome and diseases as AIDS,\r\nsyphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital herpes. And in men are pseudo hermaphroditism, anomalies of the penis,\r\nurethra, testes, prostate gland and seminal vesicles, Impotence, benign prostatic hyperplasia, Priapism,\r\ntesticular cancer and prostate disease. Intersexuality syndrome as Klinefelter, Turner, and testicular feminization. Delayed and precocious puberty in both\r\n(Rawal and Austin 2015). Infertility is one of the most serious issues that is worsening by the day and endangering\r\nthe human generation\'s future. Varicocele reduces sperm morphology and improves sperm count in people with aberrant morphology. Ovarian, cervical and prostate cancers are the deadliest of reproductive cancers. Some risk\r\nfactors for this malignancy include age, history of family and late menopause. While pregnant and breastfeeding, the\r\nlikelihood of occurrence is reduced (Salehi et al. 2008). There is a relation between metabolic and reproductive\r\ndisorders as diabetic complications can lead to some reproductive disorder as subfertility, delayed puberty or\r\ndisturbance in the menstrual cycle. Reproductive difficulties can appear early in adolescence, later, or during\r\nthe climacteric period, relying on the age at which diabetes is discovered. Decreased concentrations of LH, FSH and\r\nestradiol occurred in type 2 human studies (Gnanadass et al. 2021).\r\nBecause of central hypogonadism, women with type 1 diabetes sometimes have amenorrhoea, polycystic ovarian\r\nsyndrome and hyperandrogenism, and infertility that can be controlled by insulin administration and improved\r\nmetabolic disorder (Codner et al. 2012). Also, type 2 diabetes is related to other reproductive disorders like obesity and insulin resistance related to polycystic ovarian syndrome due to improper lifestyle. Although pubertal breast development appears to be delayed in type 1 diabetes, some people with type 1 diabetes still experience a small delay in menarche due to diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy (Calcaterra et al. 2021). The most common menstrual cycle abnormalities are oligomenorrhoea and\r\nprolonged cycle length that are related to patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, studies revealed that these disturbances\r\nare more than six times than normal women without diabetes. Disturbance in BMI, sex steroid and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations is also related to\r\ntype 2 diabetes (Thong et al. 2021).', 'Study Ethical Approval\r\nThe authors confirm that the ethical policies of the\r\njournal have been adhered to and the appropriate ethical\r\nreview committee approval has been received. The authors\r\nfollowed EU standards for the protection of animals used\r\nfor scientific purposes. The experimental work was\r\nconducted at Sakha Research Station in Kafrelsheikh\r\nGovernorate, Animal Production Research Institute,\r\nAgricultural Research Center, the Ministry of Agriculture,\r\nEgypt. The laboratory part conducted at laboratories of\r\nNational Research Centre, Animal Production Department,\r\nEgypt, and By-Products Research Department, Animal\r\nProduction Research Institute, Agricultural Research\r\nCenter, Egypt.\r\nExtracts of Olive Leaves and Olive Pomace\r\nOlive leaves and pomace were extracted using 65\r\npercent ethanol with vigorous stirring for three hours\r\nadopting a heat reflux extraction procedure. The extract\r\nwas then separated at 40°C using a rotary evaporator\r\n(Loghmanifar et al. 2020; Elsherif et al. 2021). Finally,\r\nCalcium carbonate was added as a carrier material to load\r\nthe extracts separately, giving them the ability to use and\r\nmix with feed ingredients.\r\nExperimental Diets\r\nAccording to Agriculture Ministry Decree, 1996\r\nrequirements, the control diet was formed to meet all the\r\nnutritional needs of growing rabbits. Control (without\r\nadditives), OLE1 (Olive leaves extract, 200ppm), OLE2\r\n(olive leaves extract, 400ppm), OPE1 (olive pomace\r\nextract, 200ppm) and OPE2 (olive pomace extract,\r\n400ppm) were the five treatments. The experiment lasted\r\n56 days (from 42-98 days of age). Table 1 shows the\r\ncomposition of the control diet as well as the computed\r\nanalyses.\r\nAnimals and Management\r\nSeventy-five APRI growing rabbits were divided into\r\nfive groups of 15 rabbits each at 42 days of age (624g\r\naverage body weight). Rabbits were kept in battery cages\r\nwith separate feeding units. Water and diets were available\r\nad libitum. All the rabbits were kept in the same sanitary\r\nand managerial settings. Weekly feed intake and live body\r\nweight were recorded and the feed efficiency and body\r\nweight gained were computed.\r\nDigestibility Trail\r\nAt the end of this experiment, seven rabbits from each\r\ngroup were used in a digestibility test. Feces were collected\r\ndaily, weighed, dried at 60°C for 24 hours, roughly\r\npowdered, and stored for AOAC, 2000 chemical analysis.\r\nAccording to Pérez et al. (1995), the coefficients of\r\ndigestion and nutritional values of the dietary treatments\r\nwere calculated using data from amounts and chemical\r\nanalyses of feed and feces.\r\nCarcass Characteristics and Blood Samples\r\nFive rabbits from each treatment were starved for 24\r\nhours and slaughtered for carcass and internal organs at the\r\nend of the experiment. The percentages of carcass and\r\norgans as a percentage of live weights were calculated.\r\nBlood samples were taken from the slaughtered rabbits as\r\nwell.\r\nAnalyses of Antioxidants Status\r\nBlood serum samples were separated by centrifugation\r\nat 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, then stored at -20°C until\r\nchemical analysis. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and\r\nmalondialdehyde (MDA) levels in blood serum were\r\nexamined. The livers were also obtained for the\r\nmeasurement of hepatic CAT, SOD, and GSH antioxidant\r\nenzymes in an automated calibration spectrophotometer\r\nwith high-performance readings (bio diagnostic, Cairo,\r\nEgypt) (FlexorEL200 Biochemical Analyzer).\r\nThyroid Hormone Concentration\r\nTotal T3 and T4 levels in the blood were measured\r\nusing commercial ELISA kits (MyBioSource, Inc., San\r\nDiego, CA). By dividing the T3 value by the T4 value, the\r\nT3/T4 ratio was computed.\r\nCecum pH, Ammonia Nitrogen Concentration and\r\nTotal Volatile Fatty Acids\r\nCecum contents samples were taken from slaughtered\r\nrabbits and utilized to measure cecum pH using a digital pH\r\nmeter immediately. Conway (1958) technique was used to\r\ndetermine the ammonia nitrogen concentration. According\r\nto Eadie et al. (1967), the total volatile fatty acids in caecum were determined using steam distillation unit.\r\nEconomic Efficiency At the end of the trial period, the economic efficiency profit of rabbit production were calculated using the following formula:\r\n➢ (Total feed cost + additives cost) Equals total cost per rabbit.\r\n➢ (Body weight gain (kg) x selling price of kg rabbit) Equals total return per rabbit (Egyptian pound, L.E).\r\n➢ Total return per rabbit - total cost per rabbit equals net return per rabbit (L.E.).\r\n➢ Net return per rabbit divided by total cost per rabbit equals economic efficiency (L.E.).\r\n➢ Economic efficiency of each treatment calculated for each one with multiplying by 100 (control economic efficiency).\r\n\r\n', 'Performance Parameters\r\nTable 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on body weight (bwt), weight gain (WG), feed\r\nintake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in growing\r\nrabbits. The results revealed that adding 200ppm (OLE1,\r\nOPE1) or 400ppm (OLE2, OPE2) of olive leaves extract or\r\nolive pomace extract raised the final bwt linearly (P<0.05).\r\nIn comparison to the control diet, which had a final body\r\nweight of 2011g, OPE1 had the highest value (2175g).\r\nThere were no significant variations in bwt between the\r\ngroups given OLE or OPE at the two levels tested. The\r\naddition of OLE or OPE greatly improved WG at all ages,\r\nand the results of WG followed the same trend as bwt. OPE\r\nhad a better effect on WG than OLE, although there were\r\nno significant differences between them. The feed intake of\r\nrabbits fed varied amounts of OLE or OPE in their diets\r\nwas unaffected linearly (P<0.05). In terms of FCR, adding\r\nOLE or OPE to growing rabbit diets enhanced FCR linearly\r\n(P<0.05) during the period of the trial compared to the\r\ncontrol group. The addition of OPE improved FCR more\r\nthan the addition of OLE. At the overall ages of the rabbits,\r\nthe results of the performance index (PI percent) and\r\nrelative growth rate (RGR percent) demonstrated\r\nsignificant (P<0.05) differences across the dietary\r\ntreatments. In comparison to the control, adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the rabbits\' diets enhanced PI and RGR\r\nconsiderably. The rabbits fed on OPE1-enriched diet had\r\nthe highest PI and RGR with values 69.31 and 113.12,\r\nrespectively. In terms of PI and RGR, there were no\r\nsignificant changes between OLE and OPE.\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nTable 3 shows the effect of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on the digestibility coefficients and nutritional\r\nvalues of growing rabbits. The addition of OLE or OPE had\r\nno effect on the digestibility coefficients of CF, EE, or\r\nNFE. The addition of OLE or OPE raised the digestibility\r\ncoefficient of CP substantially (P<0.05). The groups fed\r\nOLE2 and OPE2 had the best digestibility coefficients for\r\nDM, OM and CP. When compared to the control, the\r\naddition of OLE or OPE significantly (P<0.05) enhanced\r\ntotal digestible nutrients (TDN), digestible energy (DE),\r\nand digestible crude protein (DCP).\r\nCarcass Characteristics\r\nTable 4 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\ncarcass traits. The addition of OLE or OLP enhanced\r\nsignificantly (P<0.05) carcass percent. The groups\r\nsupplemented with OLE2 or OPE2 had the highest carcass\r\npercent. The proportion of live body weight of the liver,\r\nheart, kidney, giblets, and spleen did not change because of\r\nthe varied additions. The control group had the greatest\r\nGIT percent, and dietary treatments supplementation with\r\ndifferent levels of extracts significantly (P<0.05) reduced\r\nGIT weight as a proportion of live body weight.\r\nAntioxidant Status\r\nTable 5 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\nrabbit antioxidant enzymes. When compared to the control\r\ngroup, the addition of olive leaves extract or olive pomace\r\nextract at 200 and 400ppm significantly improved total\r\nantioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD),\r\nand catalase (CAT). MDA, on the other hand, was\r\nconsiderably (P<0.05) reduced when OLE or OPE were\r\nadded.\r\nThyroid Hormones\r\nThe results of thyroid hormones were found in\r\ngrowing rabbits, as shown in Fig. 1. The addition of olive\r\nleaves extract or olive pomace extract to growing rabbit\r\ndiets at 200 or 400 ppm had no effect on T3, T4, or T4/T3\r\nin any of the groups.\r\nCaecum Fermentation Activities\r\nFig. 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and olive\r\npomace extracts on caecum total volatile fatty acids\r\n(TVFAs), ammonia nitrogen and pH. The addition of OLE\r\nor OPE had a significant (P<0.05) influence on caecum\r\nTVFAs and ammonia concentrations. The TVFA values for\r\nthe treatment groups varied from 4.16 to 4.14 (ml\r\neq/100mL) compared to 3.85 for the control group.\r\nTreatment ammonia concentrations were from 8.49 to 8.32\r\nmg/100mL, compared to 9.76mg/100 ml for the control.\r\nThe pH levels were unaffected and varied from 5.80 to 5.57\r\nfor the treatment groups compared to 5.97 for the control\r\ngroup.\r\nEconomic Efficiency\r\nTable 6 shows the impact of dietary treatments on\r\neconomic efficiency (EE) and relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE). The results showed that adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the diet of rabbits improved their relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE) compared to the control group. When\r\ncompared to the control diet, REE levels increased by\r\n13.56 and 18.64 percent with OLE1 and OLE2, and by\r\n25.42 and 19.49 percent with OPE1 and OPE2 for rabbit\r\ndiets, respectively.', 'Performance Parameters\r\nResults finding are confirmed by Oke et al. (2017),\r\nwho detected that supplementing olive leaves extract in the\r\ndrinking water of broiler chicks enhanced final body\r\nweight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio linearly\r\n(P<0.05). The induction of antimicrobial activity with olive\r\nleaves extract components may be linked to growth\r\nperformance improvements of broilers fed with OLE in\r\ndrinking water (10mL/L) (Jabri et al. 2017). Furthermore,\r\nthe enhanced performance rate of rabbits given olive leaves extract might be attributable to the antioxidant,\r\nantibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral\r\ncharacteristics of olive leaves extract (Aliabadi et al. 2012).\r\nAccording to Shafey et al. (2013), adding olive leaves\r\nextract (0, 1.8, 3.6, and 6.25g/kg) to broiler diets had no\r\neffect on feed consumption. According to Bahsi et al.\r\n(2016), adding 400 ppm of oleuropein to Japanese quail\r\nmeal boosted feed conversion ratio considerably. Ahmed et\r\nal. (2017) found that feeding laying hens 50, 100, or 150mg\r\nof oleuropein/kg diet enhanced egg production, egg mass,\r\nand feed conversion ratio considerably. Héla et al. (2019)\r\nfound that adding olive leaves aqueous extract to the\r\ndrinking water of developing rabbits at a concentration of\r\n20ml/L boosted daily body weight growth and feed\r\nconversion ratio linearly (P<0.05). The inclusion of 750\r\nppm of an olive pomace extract containing 10% total\r\ntriterpenes and 2% polyphenols considerably increased\r\nbroiler chick development performance (Herrero-Encinas\r\net al 2020). When OLE (75, 150, 300 and 600mg/kg) was\r\nadded to broiler chicken diets, body weight gain, carcass\r\nweight, and feed conversion ratio were improved (P<0.05)\r\nlinearly (Erener et al. 2020). The results of current study\r\nfound that enhanced growth performance in rabbits given\r\nOLE or OPE might be linked to FCR, digestive enzyme\r\nactivity, and nutrient absorption improvement, as well as\r\ncontrolling the gut microbiota, these findings also agreed\r\nwith the findings of Zeng et al. (2015).\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nThe inclusion of OLE2 and OPE2 resulted in the\r\ngreatest improvement in TDN, DCP, and DE percent. In\r\nterms of TDN, DCP, and DE percent, there were no\r\nsignificance differences between OLE1 and control.\r\nBroiler diets which contain olive leaves extracts, enhancing growth performance and feed efficiency due to the\r\nimprovement in nutritional digestibility, digestive enzyme\r\nactivation, and intestinal morphology (Leskovec et al.\r\n2018). This improvement might be attributed to a decrease\r\nin digesta viscosity, which boosts nutrient and enzyme\r\ndiffusion rates, allowing the animal to digest and absorb\r\nmore nutrients, resulting in improved intestinal health\r\n(Morrison et al. 2017). Furthermore, phenolic compounds\r\nin olive leaves can act as antioxidants and antibacterial,\r\nresulting in the growth of beneficial microflora and the\r\ndegradation of harmful or pathogenic microflora in the\r\ndigestive tract and caecum, resulting in improved nutrient\r\ndigestibility (Korukluoglu et al. 2010; Hamad 2015; Sarica\r\nand Ürkmez 2016; Thielmann et al. 2017; Elsherif et al. 2021).', 'These results suggested that including 200 and\r\n400ppm of olive leaves or olive pomace extracts into the\r\ndiet of growing rabbits might increase growth, carcass\r\ncharacteristics, antioxidant status, and economic efficiency\r\nwithout any negative effect on their health', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'Abaza L, Taamalli A, Nsir H and Zarrouk M, 2015.

Metabolic disorders occur when the body\'s normal metabolic process is disrupted by abnormal chemical reactions. It can also be characterized as a hereditary single gene aberration, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (Zheng et al. 2021). Physical inactivity, cigarette smoking and an elevated BMI are all\r\nlifestyle risk factors. Other causes include hypertension, poor glucose metabolism and high blood pressure and\r\ncholesterol concentration contribute to these disorders (Akhuemonkhan and Lazo 2017). Lethargy, weight loss, jaundice, and seizures are some of the signs of metabolic diseases. Symptoms would differ depending on the type of metabolic disease. Acute symptoms, late-onset acute\r\nsymptoms, gradual general symptoms, and persistent symptoms are the four types of symptoms (Agana et al. 2018; Mendrick et al. 2018). Inherited metabolic diseases\r\nare a type of metabolic disorder caused by a faulty gene that results in an enzyme deficit. Inborn errors of metabolism are a group of disorders with a variety of subtypes. When the liver or pancreas does not function properly, metabolic disorders might develop. Fig. 1 represented some types of metabolic disorders (Hernández-Granados et al. 2018). Any sickness or disorder that affects the human reproductive system is referred to as reproductive disorders.\r\nImproper hormone yielding via ovaries or testes, as well as other endocrine glands is among them . Genetic or congenital\r\ndefects, infections, tumors, or disorders of unknown sources can all cause these diseases (Hutson et al. 2014) .\r\nGenetic abnormalities, genital anomalies, infections,\r\nstructural differences, and cancers are the primary divisions of these disorders (Rawal and Austin 2015; Elshazly et al.\r\n2019). Symptoms of reproductive disorders are bleeding in between periods and within it, itching, burning of the\r\ngenital area, and pain during sex, severe pelvic/abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination (Hutson et\r\nal. 2014). Common reproductive conditions for human females are anomalies of the clitoris, vagina and uterus,\r\nabnormalities of menstrual cycle endometriosis, cancers, polycystic ovarian syndrome and diseases as AIDS,\r\nsyphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital herpes. And in men are pseudo hermaphroditism, anomalies of the penis,\r\nurethra, testes, prostate gland and seminal vesicles, Impotence, benign prostatic hyperplasia, Priapism,\r\ntesticular cancer and prostate disease. Intersexuality syndrome as Klinefelter, Turner, and testicular feminization. Delayed and precocious puberty in both\r\n(Rawal and Austin 2015). Infertility is one of the most serious issues that is worsening by the day and endangering\r\nthe human generation\'s future. Varicocele reduces sperm morphology and improves sperm count in people with aberrant morphology. Ovarian, cervical and prostate cancers are the deadliest of reproductive cancers. Some risk\r\nfactors for this malignancy include age, history of family and late menopause. While pregnant and breastfeeding, the\r\nlikelihood of occurrence is reduced (Salehi et al. 2008). There is a relation between metabolic and reproductive\r\ndisorders as diabetic complications can lead to some reproductive disorder as subfertility, delayed puberty or\r\ndisturbance in the menstrual cycle. Reproductive difficulties can appear early in adolescence, later, or during\r\nthe climacteric period, relying on the age at which diabetes is discovered. Decreased concentrations of LH, FSH and\r\nestradiol occurred in type 2 human studies (Gnanadass et al. 2021).\r\nBecause of central hypogonadism, women with type 1 diabetes sometimes have amenorrhoea, polycystic ovarian\r\nsyndrome and hyperandrogenism, and infertility that can be controlled by insulin administration and improved\r\nmetabolic disorder (Codner et al. 2012). Also, type 2 diabetes is related to other reproductive disorders like obesity and insulin resistance related to polycystic ovarian syndrome due to improper lifestyle. Although pubertal breast development appears to be delayed in type 1 diabetes, some people with type 1 diabetes still experience a small delay in menarche due to diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy (Calcaterra et al. 2021). The most common menstrual cycle abnormalities are oligomenorrhoea and\r\nprolonged cycle length that are related to patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, studies revealed that these disturbances\r\nare more than six times than normal women without diabetes. Disturbance in BMI, sex steroid and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations is also related to\r\ntype 2 diabetes (Thong et al. 2021).', 'Study Ethical Approval\r\nThe authors confirm that the ethical policies of the\r\njournal have been adhered to and the appropriate ethical\r\nreview committee approval has been received. The authors\r\nfollowed EU standards for the protection of animals used\r\nfor scientific purposes. The experimental work was\r\nconducted at Sakha Research Station in Kafrelsheikh\r\nGovernorate, Animal Production Research Institute,\r\nAgricultural Research Center, the Ministry of Agriculture,\r\nEgypt. The laboratory part conducted at laboratories of\r\nNational Research Centre, Animal Production Department,\r\nEgypt, and By-Products Research Department, Animal\r\nProduction Research Institute, Agricultural Research\r\nCenter, Egypt.\r\nExtracts of Olive Leaves and Olive Pomace\r\nOlive leaves and pomace were extracted using 65\r\npercent ethanol with vigorous stirring for three hours\r\nadopting a heat reflux extraction procedure. The extract\r\nwas then separated at 40°C using a rotary evaporator\r\n(Loghmanifar et al. 2020; Elsherif et al. 2021). Finally,\r\nCalcium carbonate was added as a carrier material to load\r\nthe extracts separately, giving them the ability to use and\r\nmix with feed ingredients.\r\nExperimental Diets\r\nAccording to Agriculture Ministry Decree, 1996\r\nrequirements, the control diet was formed to meet all the\r\nnutritional needs of growing rabbits. Control (without\r\nadditives), OLE1 (Olive leaves extract, 200ppm), OLE2\r\n(olive leaves extract, 400ppm), OPE1 (olive pomace\r\nextract, 200ppm) and OPE2 (olive pomace extract,\r\n400ppm) were the five treatments. The experiment lasted\r\n56 days (from 42-98 days of age). Table 1 shows the\r\ncomposition of the control diet as well as the computed\r\nanalyses.\r\nAnimals and Management\r\nSeventy-five APRI growing rabbits were divided into\r\nfive groups of 15 rabbits each at 42 days of age (624g\r\naverage body weight). Rabbits were kept in battery cages\r\nwith separate feeding units. Water and diets were available\r\nad libitum. All the rabbits were kept in the same sanitary\r\nand managerial settings. Weekly feed intake and live body\r\nweight were recorded and the feed efficiency and body\r\nweight gained were computed.\r\nDigestibility Trail\r\nAt the end of this experiment, seven rabbits from each\r\ngroup were used in a digestibility test. Feces were collected\r\ndaily, weighed, dried at 60°C for 24 hours, roughly\r\npowdered, and stored for AOAC, 2000 chemical analysis.\r\nAccording to Pérez et al. (1995), the coefficients of\r\ndigestion and nutritional values of the dietary treatments\r\nwere calculated using data from amounts and chemical\r\nanalyses of feed and feces.\r\nCarcass Characteristics and Blood Samples\r\nFive rabbits from each treatment were starved for 24\r\nhours and slaughtered for carcass and internal organs at the\r\nend of the experiment. The percentages of carcass and\r\norgans as a percentage of live weights were calculated.\r\nBlood samples were taken from the slaughtered rabbits as\r\nwell.\r\nAnalyses of Antioxidants Status\r\nBlood serum samples were separated by centrifugation\r\nat 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, then stored at -20°C until\r\nchemical analysis. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and\r\nmalondialdehyde (MDA) levels in blood serum were\r\nexamined. The livers were also obtained for the\r\nmeasurement of hepatic CAT, SOD, and GSH antioxidant\r\nenzymes in an automated calibration spectrophotometer\r\nwith high-performance readings (bio diagnostic, Cairo,\r\nEgypt) (FlexorEL200 Biochemical Analyzer).\r\nThyroid Hormone Concentration\r\nTotal T3 and T4 levels in the blood were measured\r\nusing commercial ELISA kits (MyBioSource, Inc., San\r\nDiego, CA). By dividing the T3 value by the T4 value, the\r\nT3/T4 ratio was computed.\r\nCecum pH, Ammonia Nitrogen Concentration and\r\nTotal Volatile Fatty Acids\r\nCecum contents samples were taken from slaughtered\r\nrabbits and utilized to measure cecum pH using a digital pH\r\nmeter immediately. Conway (1958) technique was used to\r\ndetermine the ammonia nitrogen concentration. According\r\nto Eadie et al. (1967), the total volatile fatty acids in caecum were determined using steam distillation unit.\r\nEconomic Efficiency At the end of the trial period, the economic efficiency profit of rabbit production were calculated using the following formula:\r\n➢ (Total feed cost + additives cost) Equals total cost per rabbit.\r\n➢ (Body weight gain (kg) x selling price of kg rabbit) Equals total return per rabbit (Egyptian pound, L.E).\r\n➢ Total return per rabbit - total cost per rabbit equals net return per rabbit (L.E.).\r\n➢ Net return per rabbit divided by total cost per rabbit equals economic efficiency (L.E.).\r\n➢ Economic efficiency of each treatment calculated for each one with multiplying by 100 (control economic efficiency).\r\n\r\n', 'Performance Parameters\r\nTable 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on body weight (bwt), weight gain (WG), feed\r\nintake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in growing\r\nrabbits. The results revealed that adding 200ppm (OLE1,\r\nOPE1) or 400ppm (OLE2, OPE2) of olive leaves extract or\r\nolive pomace extract raised the final bwt linearly (P<0.05).\r\nIn comparison to the control diet, which had a final body\r\nweight of 2011g, OPE1 had the highest value (2175g).\r\nThere were no significant variations in bwt between the\r\ngroups given OLE or OPE at the two levels tested. The\r\naddition of OLE or OPE greatly improved WG at all ages,\r\nand the results of WG followed the same trend as bwt. OPE\r\nhad a better effect on WG than OLE, although there were\r\nno significant differences between them. The feed intake of\r\nrabbits fed varied amounts of OLE or OPE in their diets\r\nwas unaffected linearly (P<0.05). In terms of FCR, adding\r\nOLE or OPE to growing rabbit diets enhanced FCR linearly\r\n(P<0.05) during the period of the trial compared to the\r\ncontrol group. The addition of OPE improved FCR more\r\nthan the addition of OLE. At the overall ages of the rabbits,\r\nthe results of the performance index (PI percent) and\r\nrelative growth rate (RGR percent) demonstrated\r\nsignificant (P<0.05) differences across the dietary\r\ntreatments. In comparison to the control, adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the rabbits\' diets enhanced PI and RGR\r\nconsiderably. The rabbits fed on OPE1-enriched diet had\r\nthe highest PI and RGR with values 69.31 and 113.12,\r\nrespectively. In terms of PI and RGR, there were no\r\nsignificant changes between OLE and OPE.\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nTable 3 shows the effect of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on the digestibility coefficients and nutritional\r\nvalues of growing rabbits. The addition of OLE or OPE had\r\nno effect on the digestibility coefficients of CF, EE, or\r\nNFE. The addition of OLE or OPE raised the digestibility\r\ncoefficient of CP substantially (P<0.05). The groups fed\r\nOLE2 and OPE2 had the best digestibility coefficients for\r\nDM, OM and CP. When compared to the control, the\r\naddition of OLE or OPE significantly (P<0.05) enhanced\r\ntotal digestible nutrients (TDN), digestible energy (DE),\r\nand digestible crude protein (DCP).\r\nCarcass Characteristics\r\nTable 4 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\ncarcass traits. The addition of OLE or OLP enhanced\r\nsignificantly (P<0.05) carcass percent. The groups\r\nsupplemented with OLE2 or OPE2 had the highest carcass\r\npercent. The proportion of live body weight of the liver,\r\nheart, kidney, giblets, and spleen did not change because of\r\nthe varied additions. The control group had the greatest\r\nGIT percent, and dietary treatments supplementation with\r\ndifferent levels of extracts significantly (P<0.05) reduced\r\nGIT weight as a proportion of live body weight.\r\nAntioxidant Status\r\nTable 5 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\nrabbit antioxidant enzymes. When compared to the control\r\ngroup, the addition of olive leaves extract or olive pomace\r\nextract at 200 and 400ppm significantly improved total\r\nantioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD),\r\nand catalase (CAT). MDA, on the other hand, was\r\nconsiderably (P<0.05) reduced when OLE or OPE were\r\nadded.\r\nThyroid Hormones\r\nThe results of thyroid hormones were found in\r\ngrowing rabbits, as shown in Fig. 1. The addition of olive\r\nleaves extract or olive pomace extract to growing rabbit\r\ndiets at 200 or 400 ppm had no effect on T3, T4, or T4/T3\r\nin any of the groups.\r\nCaecum Fermentation Activities\r\nFig. 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and olive\r\npomace extracts on caecum total volatile fatty acids\r\n(TVFAs), ammonia nitrogen and pH. The addition of OLE\r\nor OPE had a significant (P<0.05) influence on caecum\r\nTVFAs and ammonia concentrations. The TVFA values for\r\nthe treatment groups varied from 4.16 to 4.14 (ml\r\neq/100mL) compared to 3.85 for the control group.\r\nTreatment ammonia concentrations were from 8.49 to 8.32\r\nmg/100mL, compared to 9.76mg/100 ml for the control.\r\nThe pH levels were unaffected and varied from 5.80 to 5.57\r\nfor the treatment groups compared to 5.97 for the control\r\ngroup.\r\nEconomic Efficiency\r\nTable 6 shows the impact of dietary treatments on\r\neconomic efficiency (EE) and relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE). The results showed that adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the diet of rabbits improved their relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE) compared to the control group. When\r\ncompared to the control diet, REE levels increased by\r\n13.56 and 18.64 percent with OLE1 and OLE2, and by\r\n25.42 and 19.49 percent with OPE1 and OPE2 for rabbit\r\ndiets, respectively.', 'Performance Parameters\r\nResults finding are confirmed by Oke et al. (2017),\r\nwho detected that supplementing olive leaves extract in the\r\ndrinking water of broiler chicks enhanced final body\r\nweight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio linearly\r\n(P<0.05). The induction of antimicrobial activity with olive\r\nleaves extract components may be linked to growth\r\nperformance improvements of broilers fed with OLE in\r\ndrinking water (10mL/L) (Jabri et al. 2017). Furthermore,\r\nthe enhanced performance rate of rabbits given olive leaves extract might be attributable to the antioxidant,\r\nantibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral\r\ncharacteristics of olive leaves extract (Aliabadi et al. 2012).\r\nAccording to Shafey et al. (2013), adding olive leaves\r\nextract (0, 1.8, 3.6, and 6.25g/kg) to broiler diets had no\r\neffect on feed consumption. According to Bahsi et al.\r\n(2016), adding 400 ppm of oleuropein to Japanese quail\r\nmeal boosted feed conversion ratio considerably. Ahmed et\r\nal. (2017) found that feeding laying hens 50, 100, or 150mg\r\nof oleuropein/kg diet enhanced egg production, egg mass,\r\nand feed conversion ratio considerably. Héla et al. (2019)\r\nfound that adding olive leaves aqueous extract to the\r\ndrinking water of developing rabbits at a concentration of\r\n20ml/L boosted daily body weight growth and feed\r\nconversion ratio linearly (P<0.05). The inclusion of 750\r\nppm of an olive pomace extract containing 10% total\r\ntriterpenes and 2% polyphenols considerably increased\r\nbroiler chick development performance (Herrero-Encinas\r\net al 2020). When OLE (75, 150, 300 and 600mg/kg) was\r\nadded to broiler chicken diets, body weight gain, carcass\r\nweight, and feed conversion ratio were improved (P<0.05)\r\nlinearly (Erener et al. 2020). The results of current study\r\nfound that enhanced growth performance in rabbits given\r\nOLE or OPE might be linked to FCR, digestive enzyme\r\nactivity, and nutrient absorption improvement, as well as\r\ncontrolling the gut microbiota, these findings also agreed\r\nwith the findings of Zeng et al. (2015).\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nThe inclusion of OLE2 and OPE2 resulted in the\r\ngreatest improvement in TDN, DCP, and DE percent. In\r\nterms of TDN, DCP, and DE percent, there were no\r\nsignificance differences between OLE1 and control.\r\nBroiler diets which contain olive leaves extracts, enhancing growth performance and feed efficiency due to the\r\nimprovement in nutritional digestibility, digestive enzyme\r\nactivation, and intestinal morphology (Leskovec et al.\r\n2018). This improvement might be attributed to a decrease\r\nin digesta viscosity, which boosts nutrient and enzyme\r\ndiffusion rates, allowing the animal to digest and absorb\r\nmore nutrients, resulting in improved intestinal health\r\n(Morrison et al. 2017). Furthermore, phenolic compounds\r\nin olive leaves can act as antioxidants and antibacterial,\r\nresulting in the growth of beneficial microflora and the\r\ndegradation of harmful or pathogenic microflora in the\r\ndigestive tract and caecum, resulting in improved nutrient\r\ndigestibility (Korukluoglu et al. 2010; Hamad 2015; Sarica\r\nand Ürkmez 2016; Thielmann et al. 2017; Elsherif et al. 2021).', 'These results suggested that including 200 and\r\n400ppm of olive leaves or olive pomace extracts into the\r\ndiet of growing rabbits might increase growth, carcass\r\ncharacteristics, antioxidant status, and economic efficiency\r\nwithout any negative effect on their health', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'Abaza L, Taamalli A, Nsir H and Zarrouk M, 2015.

This study aimed to\r\ninvestigate alterations in serum biochemical, mineral status and hematologic value in lactating ewes and does\r\ncompared with non-lactating animals under same condition (climate, feeding and rearing system). Significant\r\nreduction in RBCs, HB, and PCV% along with significant increase in MCV were the most consistent hematologic\r\nalterations. Significant reduction in protein and lipid profile along with increase in BUN was the most consistent\r\nbiochemical alteration. The minerals profile showed decrease in Zinc, Copper and Calcium, though PH\r\nshowed no\r\nchange. In Conclusion, this study showed that the lactation has significant effect on body metabolites, hematologic\r\nand mineral storage in small ruminant, for future production scheme, failure to substitute those deficit, will have a bad\r\nimpact on health and metabolism of animal production lifespan.', '0000-00-00', '0000-00-00', '0000-00-00', '0000-00-00', 'The author would like to express gratitude to Prof Fayez Salib and Dr Mohamed A Elkhiat for their help in samples collection', 'Lactation, Ewe, Doe, Hemato-biochemical, Mineral', '10.47278/journal.ijvs/2022.142', 'r80anas@gmail.com', 'A metabolic disorder affects the body\'s ability to digest and distribute macronutrients including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates . Metabolic disorders occur when the body\'s normal metabolic process is disrupted by abnormal chemical reactions. It can also be characterized as a hereditary single gene aberration, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (Zheng et al. 2021). Physical inactivity, cigarette smoking and an elevated BMI are all\r\nlifestyle risk factors. Other causes include hypertension, poor glucose metabolism and high blood pressure and\r\ncholesterol concentration contribute to these disorders (Akhuemonkhan and Lazo 2017). Lethargy, weight loss, jaundice, and seizures are some of the signs of metabolic diseases. Symptoms would differ depending on the type of metabolic disease. Acute symptoms, late-onset acute\r\nsymptoms, gradual general symptoms, and persistent symptoms are the four types of symptoms (Agana et al. 2018; Mendrick et al. 2018). Inherited metabolic diseases\r\nare a type of metabolic disorder caused by a faulty gene that results in an enzyme deficit. Inborn errors of metabolism are a group of disorders with a variety of subtypes. When the liver or pancreas does not function properly, metabolic disorders might develop. Fig. 1 represented some types of metabolic disorders (Hernández-Granados et al. 2018). Any sickness or disorder that affects the human reproductive system is referred to as reproductive disorders.\r\nImproper hormone yielding via ovaries or testes, as well as other endocrine glands is among them . Genetic or congenital\r\ndefects, infections, tumors, or disorders of unknown sources can all cause these diseases (Hutson et al. 2014) .\r\nGenetic abnormalities, genital anomalies, infections,\r\nstructural differences, and cancers are the primary divisions of these disorders (Rawal and Austin 2015; Elshazly et al.\r\n2019). Symptoms of reproductive disorders are bleeding in between periods and within it, itching, burning of the\r\ngenital area, and pain during sex, severe pelvic/abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination (Hutson et\r\nal. 2014). Common reproductive conditions for human females are anomalies of the clitoris, vagina and uterus,\r\nabnormalities of menstrual cycle endometriosis, cancers, polycystic ovarian syndrome and diseases as AIDS,\r\nsyphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital herpes. And in men are pseudo hermaphroditism, anomalies of the penis,\r\nurethra, testes, prostate gland and seminal vesicles, Impotence, benign prostatic hyperplasia, Priapism,\r\ntesticular cancer and prostate disease. Intersexuality syndrome as Klinefelter, Turner, and testicular feminization. Delayed and precocious puberty in both\r\n(Rawal and Austin 2015). Infertility is one of the most serious issues that is worsening by the day and endangering\r\nthe human generation\'s future. Varicocele reduces sperm morphology and improves sperm count in people with aberrant morphology. Ovarian, cervical and prostate cancers are the deadliest of reproductive cancers. Some risk\r\nfactors for this malignancy include age, history of family and late menopause. While pregnant and breastfeeding, the\r\nlikelihood of occurrence is reduced (Salehi et al. 2008). There is a relation between metabolic and reproductive\r\ndisorders as diabetic complications can lead to some reproductive disorder as subfertility, delayed puberty or\r\ndisturbance in the menstrual cycle. Reproductive difficulties can appear early in adolescence, later, or during\r\nthe climacteric period, relying on the age at which diabetes is discovered. Decreased concentrations of LH, FSH and\r\nestradiol occurred in type 2 human studies (Gnanadass et al. 2021).\r\nBecause of central hypogonadism, women with type 1 diabetes sometimes have amenorrhoea, polycystic ovarian\r\nsyndrome and hyperandrogenism, and infertility that can be controlled by insulin administration and improved\r\nmetabolic disorder (Codner et al. 2012). Also, type 2 diabetes is related to other reproductive disorders like obesity and insulin resistance related to polycystic ovarian syndrome due to improper lifestyle. Although pubertal breast development appears to be delayed in type 1 diabetes, some people with type 1 diabetes still experience a small delay in menarche due to diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy (Calcaterra et al. 2021). The most common menstrual cycle abnormalities are oligomenorrhoea and\r\nprolonged cycle length that are related to patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, studies revealed that these disturbances\r\nare more than six times than normal women without diabetes. Disturbance in BMI, sex steroid and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations is also related to\r\ntype 2 diabetes (Thong et al. 2021).', 'Study Ethical Approval\r\nThe authors confirm that the ethical policies of the\r\njournal have been adhered to and the appropriate ethical\r\nreview committee approval has been received. The authors\r\nfollowed EU standards for the protection of animals used\r\nfor scientific purposes. The experimental work was\r\nconducted at Sakha Research Station in Kafrelsheikh\r\nGovernorate, Animal Production Research Institute,\r\nAgricultural Research Center, the Ministry of Agriculture,\r\nEgypt. The laboratory part conducted at laboratories of\r\nNational Research Centre, Animal Production Department,\r\nEgypt, and By-Products Research Department, Animal\r\nProduction Research Institute, Agricultural Research\r\nCenter, Egypt.\r\nExtracts of Olive Leaves and Olive Pomace\r\nOlive leaves and pomace were extracted using 65\r\npercent ethanol with vigorous stirring for three hours\r\nadopting a heat reflux extraction procedure. The extract\r\nwas then separated at 40°C using a rotary evaporator\r\n(Loghmanifar et al. 2020; Elsherif et al. 2021). Finally,\r\nCalcium carbonate was added as a carrier material to load\r\nthe extracts separately, giving them the ability to use and\r\nmix with feed ingredients.\r\nExperimental Diets\r\nAccording to Agriculture Ministry Decree, 1996\r\nrequirements, the control diet was formed to meet all the\r\nnutritional needs of growing rabbits. Control (without\r\nadditives), OLE1 (Olive leaves extract, 200ppm), OLE2\r\n(olive leaves extract, 400ppm), OPE1 (olive pomace\r\nextract, 200ppm) and OPE2 (olive pomace extract,\r\n400ppm) were the five treatments. The experiment lasted\r\n56 days (from 42-98 days of age). Table 1 shows the\r\ncomposition of the control diet as well as the computed\r\nanalyses.\r\nAnimals and Management\r\nSeventy-five APRI growing rabbits were divided into\r\nfive groups of 15 rabbits each at 42 days of age (624g\r\naverage body weight). Rabbits were kept in battery cages\r\nwith separate feeding units. Water and diets were available\r\nad libitum. All the rabbits were kept in the same sanitary\r\nand managerial settings. Weekly feed intake and live body\r\nweight were recorded and the feed efficiency and body\r\nweight gained were computed.\r\nDigestibility Trail\r\nAt the end of this experiment, seven rabbits from each\r\ngroup were used in a digestibility test. Feces were collected\r\ndaily, weighed, dried at 60°C for 24 hours, roughly\r\npowdered, and stored for AOAC, 2000 chemical analysis.\r\nAccording to Pérez et al. (1995), the coefficients of\r\ndigestion and nutritional values of the dietary treatments\r\nwere calculated using data from amounts and chemical\r\nanalyses of feed and feces.\r\nCarcass Characteristics and Blood Samples\r\nFive rabbits from each treatment were starved for 24\r\nhours and slaughtered for carcass and internal organs at the\r\nend of the experiment. The percentages of carcass and\r\norgans as a percentage of live weights were calculated.\r\nBlood samples were taken from the slaughtered rabbits as\r\nwell.\r\nAnalyses of Antioxidants Status\r\nBlood serum samples were separated by centrifugation\r\nat 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, then stored at -20°C until\r\nchemical analysis. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and\r\nmalondialdehyde (MDA) levels in blood serum were\r\nexamined. The livers were also obtained for the\r\nmeasurement of hepatic CAT, SOD, and GSH antioxidant\r\nenzymes in an automated calibration spectrophotometer\r\nwith high-performance readings (bio diagnostic, Cairo,\r\nEgypt) (FlexorEL200 Biochemical Analyzer).\r\nThyroid Hormone Concentration\r\nTotal T3 and T4 levels in the blood were measured\r\nusing commercial ELISA kits (MyBioSource, Inc., San\r\nDiego, CA). By dividing the T3 value by the T4 value, the\r\nT3/T4 ratio was computed.\r\nCecum pH, Ammonia Nitrogen Concentration and\r\nTotal Volatile Fatty Acids\r\nCecum contents samples were taken from slaughtered\r\nrabbits and utilized to measure cecum pH using a digital pH\r\nmeter immediately. Conway (1958) technique was used to\r\ndetermine the ammonia nitrogen concentration. According\r\nto Eadie et al. (1967), the total volatile fatty acids in caecum were determined using steam distillation unit.\r\nEconomic Efficiency At the end of the trial period, the economic efficiency profit of rabbit production were calculated using the following formula:\r\n➢ (Total feed cost + additives cost) Equals total cost per rabbit.\r\n➢ (Body weight gain (kg) x selling price of kg rabbit) Equals total return per rabbit (Egyptian pound, L.E).\r\n➢ Total return per rabbit - total cost per rabbit equals net return per rabbit (L.E.).\r\n➢ Net return per rabbit divided by total cost per rabbit equals economic efficiency (L.E.).\r\n➢ Economic efficiency of each treatment calculated for each one with multiplying by 100 (control economic efficiency).\r\n\r\n', 'Performance Parameters\r\nTable 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on body weight (bwt), weight gain (WG), feed\r\nintake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in growing\r\nrabbits. The results revealed that adding 200ppm (OLE1,\r\nOPE1) or 400ppm (OLE2, OPE2) of olive leaves extract or\r\nolive pomace extract raised the final bwt linearly (P<0.05).\r\nIn comparison to the control diet, which had a final body\r\nweight of 2011g, OPE1 had the highest value (2175g).\r\nThere were no significant variations in bwt between the\r\ngroups given OLE or OPE at the two levels tested. The\r\naddition of OLE or OPE greatly improved WG at all ages,\r\nand the results of WG followed the same trend as bwt. OPE\r\nhad a better effect on WG than OLE, although there were\r\nno significant differences between them. The feed intake of\r\nrabbits fed varied amounts of OLE or OPE in their diets\r\nwas unaffected linearly (P<0.05). In terms of FCR, adding\r\nOLE or OPE to growing rabbit diets enhanced FCR linearly\r\n(P<0.05) during the period of the trial compared to the\r\ncontrol group. The addition of OPE improved FCR more\r\nthan the addition of OLE. At the overall ages of the rabbits,\r\nthe results of the performance index (PI percent) and\r\nrelative growth rate (RGR percent) demonstrated\r\nsignificant (P<0.05) differences across the dietary\r\ntreatments. In comparison to the control, adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the rabbits\' diets enhanced PI and RGR\r\nconsiderably. The rabbits fed on OPE1-enriched diet had\r\nthe highest PI and RGR with values 69.31 and 113.12,\r\nrespectively. In terms of PI and RGR, there were no\r\nsignificant changes between OLE and OPE.\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nTable 3 shows the effect of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on the digestibility coefficients and nutritional\r\nvalues of growing rabbits. The addition of OLE or OPE had\r\nno effect on the digestibility coefficients of CF, EE, or\r\nNFE. The addition of OLE or OPE raised the digestibility\r\ncoefficient of CP substantially (P<0.05). The groups fed\r\nOLE2 and OPE2 had the best digestibility coefficients for\r\nDM, OM and CP. When compared to the control, the\r\naddition of OLE or OPE significantly (P<0.05) enhanced\r\ntotal digestible nutrients (TDN), digestible energy (DE),\r\nand digestible crude protein (DCP).\r\nCarcass Characteristics\r\nTable 4 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\ncarcass traits. The addition of OLE or OLP enhanced\r\nsignificantly (P<0.05) carcass percent. The groups\r\nsupplemented with OLE2 or OPE2 had the highest carcass\r\npercent. The proportion of live body weight of the liver,\r\nheart, kidney, giblets, and spleen did not change because of\r\nthe varied additions. The control group had the greatest\r\nGIT percent, and dietary treatments supplementation with\r\ndifferent levels of extracts significantly (P<0.05) reduced\r\nGIT weight as a proportion of live body weight.\r\nAntioxidant Status\r\nTable 5 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\nrabbit antioxidant enzymes. When compared to the control\r\ngroup, the addition of olive leaves extract or olive pomace\r\nextract at 200 and 400ppm significantly improved total\r\nantioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD),\r\nand catalase (CAT). MDA, on the other hand, was\r\nconsiderably (P<0.05) reduced when OLE or OPE were\r\nadded.\r\nThyroid Hormones\r\nThe results of thyroid hormones were found in\r\ngrowing rabbits, as shown in Fig. 1. The addition of olive\r\nleaves extract or olive pomace extract to growing rabbit\r\ndiets at 200 or 400 ppm had no effect on T3, T4, or T4/T3\r\nin any of the groups.\r\nCaecum Fermentation Activities\r\nFig. 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and olive\r\npomace extracts on caecum total volatile fatty acids\r\n(TVFAs), ammonia nitrogen and pH. The addition of OLE\r\nor OPE had a significant (P<0.05) influence on caecum\r\nTVFAs and ammonia concentrations. The TVFA values for\r\nthe treatment groups varied from 4.16 to 4.14 (ml\r\neq/100mL) compared to 3.85 for the control group.\r\nTreatment ammonia concentrations were from 8.49 to 8.32\r\nmg/100mL, compared to 9.76mg/100 ml for the control.\r\nThe pH levels were unaffected and varied from 5.80 to 5.57\r\nfor the treatment groups compared to 5.97 for the control\r\ngroup.\r\nEconomic Efficiency\r\nTable 6 shows the impact of dietary treatments on\r\neconomic efficiency (EE) and relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE). The results showed that adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the diet of rabbits improved their relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE) compared to the control group. When\r\ncompared to the control diet, REE levels increased by\r\n13.56 and 18.64 percent with OLE1 and OLE2, and by\r\n25.42 and 19.49 percent with OPE1 and OPE2 for rabbit\r\ndiets, respectively.', 'Performance Parameters\r\nResults finding are confirmed by Oke et al. (2017),\r\nwho detected that supplementing olive leaves extract in the\r\ndrinking water of broiler chicks enhanced final body\r\nweight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio linearly\r\n(P<0.05). The induction of antimicrobial activity with olive\r\nleaves extract components may be linked to growth\r\nperformance improvements of broilers fed with OLE in\r\ndrinking water (10mL/L) (Jabri et al. 2017). Furthermore,\r\nthe enhanced performance rate of rabbits given olive leaves extract might be attributable to the antioxidant,\r\nantibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral\r\ncharacteristics of olive leaves extract (Aliabadi et al. 2012).\r\nAccording to Shafey et al. (2013), adding olive leaves\r\nextract (0, 1.8, 3.6, and 6.25g/kg) to broiler diets had no\r\neffect on feed consumption. According to Bahsi et al.\r\n(2016), adding 400 ppm of oleuropein to Japanese quail\r\nmeal boosted feed conversion ratio considerably. Ahmed et\r\nal. (2017) found that feeding laying hens 50, 100, or 150mg\r\nof oleuropein/kg diet enhanced egg production, egg mass,\r\nand feed conversion ratio considerably. Héla et al. (2019)\r\nfound that adding olive leaves aqueous extract to the\r\ndrinking water of developing rabbits at a concentration of\r\n20ml/L boosted daily body weight growth and feed\r\nconversion ratio linearly (P<0.05). The inclusion of 750\r\nppm of an olive pomace extract containing 10% total\r\ntriterpenes and 2% polyphenols considerably increased\r\nbroiler chick development performance (Herrero-Encinas\r\net al 2020). When OLE (75, 150, 300 and 600mg/kg) was\r\nadded to broiler chicken diets, body weight gain, carcass\r\nweight, and feed conversion ratio were improved (P<0.05)\r\nlinearly (Erener et al. 2020). The results of current study\r\nfound that enhanced growth performance in rabbits given\r\nOLE or OPE might be linked to FCR, digestive enzyme\r\nactivity, and nutrient absorption improvement, as well as\r\ncontrolling the gut microbiota, these findings also agreed\r\nwith the findings of Zeng et al. (2015).\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nThe inclusion of OLE2 and OPE2 resulted in the\r\ngreatest improvement in TDN, DCP, and DE percent. In\r\nterms of TDN, DCP, and DE percent, there were no\r\nsignificance differences between OLE1 and control.\r\nBroiler diets which contain olive leaves extracts, enhancing growth performance and feed efficiency due to the\r\nimprovement in nutritional digestibility, digestive enzyme\r\nactivation, and intestinal morphology (Leskovec et al.\r\n2018). This improvement might be attributed to a decrease\r\nin digesta viscosity, which boosts nutrient and enzyme\r\ndiffusion rates, allowing the animal to digest and absorb\r\nmore nutrients, resulting in improved intestinal health\r\n(Morrison et al. 2017). Furthermore, phenolic compounds\r\nin olive leaves can act as antioxidants and antibacterial,\r\nresulting in the growth of beneficial microflora and the\r\ndegradation of harmful or pathogenic microflora in the\r\ndigestive tract and caecum, resulting in improved nutrient\r\ndigestibility (Korukluoglu et al. 2010; Hamad 2015; Sarica\r\nand Ürkmez 2016; Thielmann et al. 2017; Elsherif et al. 2021).', 'These results suggested that including 200 and\r\n400ppm of olive leaves or olive pomace extracts into the\r\ndiet of growing rabbits might increase growth, carcass\r\ncharacteristics, antioxidant status, and economic efficiency\r\nwithout any negative effect on their health', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'Abaza L, Taamalli A, Nsir H and Zarrouk M, 2015.

This study aimed to\r\ninvestigate alterations in serum biochemical, mineral status and hematologic value in lactating ewes and does\r\ncompared with non-lactating animals under same condition (climate, feeding and rearing system). Significant\r\nreduction in RBCs, HB, and PCV% along with significant increase in MCV were the most consistent hematologic\r\nalterations. Significant reduction in protein and lipid profile along with increase in BUN was the most consistent\r\nbiochemical alteration. The minerals profile showed decrease in Zinc, Copper and Calcium, though PH\r\nshowed no\r\nchange. In Conclusion, this study showed that the lactation has significant effect on body metabolites, hematologic\r\nand mineral storage in small ruminant, for future production scheme, failure to substitute those deficit, will have a bad\r\nimpact on health and metabolism of animal production lifespan.', '0000-00-00', '0000-00-00', '0000-00-00', '0000-00-00', 'The author would like to express gratitude to Prof Fayez Salib and Dr Mohamed A Elkhiat for their help in samples collection', 'Lactation, Ewe, Doe, Hemato-biochemical, Mineral', '10.47278/journal.ijvs/2022.142', 'r80anas@gmail.com', 'A metabolic disorder affects the body\'s ability to digest and distribute macronutrients including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates . Metabolic disorders occur when the body\'s normal metabolic process is disrupted by abnormal chemical reactions. It can also be characterized as a hereditary single gene aberration, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (Zheng et al. 2021). Physical inactivity, cigarette smoking and an elevated BMI are all\r\nlifestyle risk factors. Other causes include hypertension, poor glucose metabolism and high blood pressure and\r\ncholesterol concentration contribute to these disorders (Akhuemonkhan and Lazo 2017). Lethargy, weight loss, jaundice, and seizures are some of the signs of metabolic diseases. Symptoms would differ depending on the type of metabolic disease. Acute symptoms, late-onset acute\r\nsymptoms, gradual general symptoms, and persistent symptoms are the four types of symptoms (Agana et al. 2018; Mendrick et al. 2018). Inherited metabolic diseases\r\nare a type of metabolic disorder caused by a faulty gene that results in an enzyme deficit. Inborn errors of metabolism are a group of disorders with a variety of subtypes. When the liver or pancreas does not function properly, metabolic disorders might develop. Fig. 1 represented some types of metabolic disorders (Hernández-Granados et al. 2018). Any sickness or disorder that affects the human reproductive system is referred to as reproductive disorders.\r\nImproper hormone yielding via ovaries or testes, as well as other endocrine glands is among them . Genetic or congenital\r\ndefects, infections, tumors, or disorders of unknown sources can all cause these diseases (Hutson et al. 2014) .\r\nGenetic abnormalities, genital anomalies, infections,\r\nstructural differences, and cancers are the primary divisions of these disorders (Rawal and Austin 2015; Elshazly et al.\r\n2019). Symptoms of reproductive disorders are bleeding in between periods and within it, itching, burning of the\r\ngenital area, and pain during sex, severe pelvic/abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination (Hutson et\r\nal. 2014). Common reproductive conditions for human females are anomalies of the clitoris, vagina and uterus,\r\nabnormalities of menstrual cycle endometriosis, cancers, polycystic ovarian syndrome and diseases as AIDS,\r\nsyphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital herpes. And in men are pseudo hermaphroditism, anomalies of the penis,\r\nurethra, testes, prostate gland and seminal vesicles, Impotence, benign prostatic hyperplasia, Priapism,\r\ntesticular cancer and prostate disease. Intersexuality syndrome as Klinefelter, Turner, and testicular feminization. Delayed and precocious puberty in both\r\n(Rawal and Austin 2015). Infertility is one of the most serious issues that is worsening by the day and endangering\r\nthe human generation\'s future. Varicocele reduces sperm morphology and improves sperm count in people with aberrant morphology. Ovarian, cervical and prostate cancers are the deadliest of reproductive cancers. Some risk\r\nfactors for this malignancy include age, history of family and late menopause. While pregnant and breastfeeding, the\r\nlikelihood of occurrence is reduced (Salehi et al. 2008). There is a relation between metabolic and reproductive\r\ndisorders as diabetic complications can lead to some reproductive disorder as subfertility, delayed puberty or\r\ndisturbance in the menstrual cycle. Reproductive difficulties can appear early in adolescence, later, or during\r\nthe climacteric period, relying on the age at which diabetes is discovered. Decreased concentrations of LH, FSH and\r\nestradiol occurred in type 2 human studies (Gnanadass et al. 2021).\r\nBecause of central hypogonadism, women with type 1 diabetes sometimes have amenorrhoea, polycystic ovarian\r\nsyndrome and hyperandrogenism, and infertility that can be controlled by insulin administration and improved\r\nmetabolic disorder (Codner et al. 2012). Also, type 2 diabetes is related to other reproductive disorders like obesity and insulin resistance related to polycystic ovarian syndrome due to improper lifestyle. Although pubertal breast development appears to be delayed in type 1 diabetes, some people with type 1 diabetes still experience a small delay in menarche due to diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy (Calcaterra et al. 2021). The most common menstrual cycle abnormalities are oligomenorrhoea and\r\nprolonged cycle length that are related to patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, studies revealed that these disturbances\r\nare more than six times than normal women without diabetes. Disturbance in BMI, sex steroid and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations is also related to\r\ntype 2 diabetes (Thong et al. 2021).', 'Study Ethical Approval\r\nThe authors confirm that the ethical policies of the\r\njournal have been adhered to and the appropriate ethical\r\nreview committee approval has been received. The authors\r\nfollowed EU standards for the protection of animals used\r\nfor scientific purposes. The experimental work was\r\nconducted at Sakha Research Station in Kafrelsheikh\r\nGovernorate, Animal Production Research Institute,\r\nAgricultural Research Center, the Ministry of Agriculture,\r\nEgypt. The laboratory part conducted at laboratories of\r\nNational Research Centre, Animal Production Department,\r\nEgypt, and By-Products Research Department, Animal\r\nProduction Research Institute, Agricultural Research\r\nCenter, Egypt.\r\nExtracts of Olive Leaves and Olive Pomace\r\nOlive leaves and pomace were extracted using 65\r\npercent ethanol with vigorous stirring for three hours\r\nadopting a heat reflux extraction procedure. The extract\r\nwas then separated at 40°C using a rotary evaporator\r\n(Loghmanifar et al. 2020; Elsherif et al. 2021). Finally,\r\nCalcium carbonate was added as a carrier material to load\r\nthe extracts separately, giving them the ability to use and\r\nmix with feed ingredients.\r\nExperimental Diets\r\nAccording to Agriculture Ministry Decree, 1996\r\nrequirements, the control diet was formed to meet all the\r\nnutritional needs of growing rabbits. Control (without\r\nadditives), OLE1 (Olive leaves extract, 200ppm), OLE2\r\n(olive leaves extract, 400ppm), OPE1 (olive pomace\r\nextract, 200ppm) and OPE2 (olive pomace extract,\r\n400ppm) were the five treatments. The experiment lasted\r\n56 days (from 42-98 days of age). Table 1 shows the\r\ncomposition of the control diet as well as the computed\r\nanalyses.\r\nAnimals and Management\r\nSeventy-five APRI growing rabbits were divided into\r\nfive groups of 15 rabbits each at 42 days of age (624g\r\naverage body weight). Rabbits were kept in battery cages\r\nwith separate feeding units. Water and diets were available\r\nad libitum. All the rabbits were kept in the same sanitary\r\nand managerial settings. Weekly feed intake and live body\r\nweight were recorded and the feed efficiency and body\r\nweight gained were computed.\r\nDigestibility Trail\r\nAt the end of this experiment, seven rabbits from each\r\ngroup were used in a digestibility test. Feces were collected\r\ndaily, weighed, dried at 60°C for 24 hours, roughly\r\npowdered, and stored for AOAC, 2000 chemical analysis.\r\nAccording to Pérez et al. (1995), the coefficients of\r\ndigestion and nutritional values of the dietary treatments\r\nwere calculated using data from amounts and chemical\r\nanalyses of feed and feces.\r\nCarcass Characteristics and Blood Samples\r\nFive rabbits from each treatment were starved for 24\r\nhours and slaughtered for carcass and internal organs at the\r\nend of the experiment. The percentages of carcass and\r\norgans as a percentage of live weights were calculated.\r\nBlood samples were taken from the slaughtered rabbits as\r\nwell.\r\nAnalyses of Antioxidants Status\r\nBlood serum samples were separated by centrifugation\r\nat 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, then stored at -20°C until\r\nchemical analysis. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and\r\nmalondialdehyde (MDA) levels in blood serum were\r\nexamined. The livers were also obtained for the\r\nmeasurement of hepatic CAT, SOD, and GSH antioxidant\r\nenzymes in an automated calibration spectrophotometer\r\nwith high-performance readings (bio diagnostic, Cairo,\r\nEgypt) (FlexorEL200 Biochemical Analyzer).\r\nThyroid Hormone Concentration\r\nTotal T3 and T4 levels in the blood were measured\r\nusing commercial ELISA kits (MyBioSource, Inc., San\r\nDiego, CA). By dividing the T3 value by the T4 value, the\r\nT3/T4 ratio was computed.\r\nCecum pH, Ammonia Nitrogen Concentration and\r\nTotal Volatile Fatty Acids\r\nCecum contents samples were taken from slaughtered\r\nrabbits and utilized to measure cecum pH using a digital pH\r\nmeter immediately. Conway (1958) technique was used to\r\ndetermine the ammonia nitrogen concentration. According\r\nto Eadie et al. (1967), the total volatile fatty acids in caecum were determined using steam distillation unit.\r\nEconomic Efficiency At the end of the trial period, the economic efficiency profit of rabbit production were calculated using the following formula:\r\n➢ (Total feed cost + additives cost) Equals total cost per rabbit.\r\n➢ (Body weight gain (kg) x selling price of kg rabbit) Equals total return per rabbit (Egyptian pound, L.E).\r\n➢ Total return per rabbit - total cost per rabbit equals net return per rabbit (L.E.).\r\n➢ Net return per rabbit divided by total cost per rabbit equals economic efficiency (L.E.).\r\n➢ Economic efficiency of each treatment calculated for each one with multiplying by 100 (control economic efficiency).\r\n\r\n', 'Performance Parameters\r\nTable 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on body weight (bwt), weight gain (WG), feed\r\nintake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in growing\r\nrabbits. The results revealed that adding 200ppm (OLE1,\r\nOPE1) or 400ppm (OLE2, OPE2) of olive leaves extract or\r\nolive pomace extract raised the final bwt linearly (P<0.05).\r\nIn comparison to the control diet, which had a final body\r\nweight of 2011g, OPE1 had the highest value (2175g).\r\nThere were no significant variations in bwt between the\r\ngroups given OLE or OPE at the two levels tested. The\r\naddition of OLE or OPE greatly improved WG at all ages,\r\nand the results of WG followed the same trend as bwt. OPE\r\nhad a better effect on WG than OLE, although there were\r\nno significant differences between them. The feed intake of\r\nrabbits fed varied amounts of OLE or OPE in their diets\r\nwas unaffected linearly (P<0.05). In terms of FCR, adding\r\nOLE or OPE to growing rabbit diets enhanced FCR linearly\r\n(P<0.05) during the period of the trial compared to the\r\ncontrol group. The addition of OPE improved FCR more\r\nthan the addition of OLE. At the overall ages of the rabbits,\r\nthe results of the performance index (PI percent) and\r\nrelative growth rate (RGR percent) demonstrated\r\nsignificant (P<0.05) differences across the dietary\r\ntreatments. In comparison to the control, adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the rabbits\' diets enhanced PI and RGR\r\nconsiderably. The rabbits fed on OPE1-enriched diet had\r\nthe highest PI and RGR with values 69.31 and 113.12,\r\nrespectively. In terms of PI and RGR, there were no\r\nsignificant changes between OLE and OPE.\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nTable 3 shows the effect of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on the digestibility coefficients and nutritional\r\nvalues of growing rabbits. The addition of OLE or OPE had\r\nno effect on the digestibility coefficients of CF, EE, or\r\nNFE. The addition of OLE or OPE raised the digestibility\r\ncoefficient of CP substantially (P<0.05). The groups fed\r\nOLE2 and OPE2 had the best digestibility coefficients for\r\nDM, OM and CP. When compared to the control, the\r\naddition of OLE or OPE significantly (P<0.05) enhanced\r\ntotal digestible nutrients (TDN), digestible energy (DE),\r\nand digestible crude protein (DCP).\r\nCarcass Characteristics\r\nTable 4 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\ncarcass traits. The addition of OLE or OLP enhanced\r\nsignificantly (P<0.05) carcass percent. The groups\r\nsupplemented with OLE2 or OPE2 had the highest carcass\r\npercent. The proportion of live body weight of the liver,\r\nheart, kidney, giblets, and spleen did not change because of\r\nthe varied additions. The control group had the greatest\r\nGIT percent, and dietary treatments supplementation with\r\ndifferent levels of extracts significantly (P<0.05) reduced\r\nGIT weight as a proportion of live body weight.\r\nAntioxidant Status\r\nTable 5 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\nrabbit antioxidant enzymes. When compared to the control\r\ngroup, the addition of olive leaves extract or olive pomace\r\nextract at 200 and 400ppm significantly improved total\r\nantioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD),\r\nand catalase (CAT). MDA, on the other hand, was\r\nconsiderably (P<0.05) reduced when OLE or OPE were\r\nadded.\r\nThyroid Hormones\r\nThe results of thyroid hormones were found in\r\ngrowing rabbits, as shown in Fig. 1. The addition of olive\r\nleaves extract or olive pomace extract to growing rabbit\r\ndiets at 200 or 400 ppm had no effect on T3, T4, or T4/T3\r\nin any of the groups.\r\nCaecum Fermentation Activities\r\nFig. 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and olive\r\npomace extracts on caecum total volatile fatty acids\r\n(TVFAs), ammonia nitrogen and pH. The addition of OLE\r\nor OPE had a significant (P<0.05) influence on caecum\r\nTVFAs and ammonia concentrations. The TVFA values for\r\nthe treatment groups varied from 4.16 to 4.14 (ml\r\neq/100mL) compared to 3.85 for the control group.\r\nTreatment ammonia concentrations were from 8.49 to 8.32\r\nmg/100mL, compared to 9.76mg/100 ml for the control.\r\nThe pH levels were unaffected and varied from 5.80 to 5.57\r\nfor the treatment groups compared to 5.97 for the control\r\ngroup.\r\nEconomic Efficiency\r\nTable 6 shows the impact of dietary treatments on\r\neconomic efficiency (EE) and relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE). The results showed that adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the diet of rabbits improved their relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE) compared to the control group. When\r\ncompared to the control diet, REE levels increased by\r\n13.56 and 18.64 percent with OLE1 and OLE2, and by\r\n25.42 and 19.49 percent with OPE1 and OPE2 for rabbit\r\ndiets, respectively.', 'Performance Parameters\r\nResults finding are confirmed by Oke et al. (2017),\r\nwho detected that supplementing olive leaves extract in the\r\ndrinking water of broiler chicks enhanced final body\r\nweight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio linearly\r\n(P<0.05). The induction of antimicrobial activity with olive\r\nleaves extract components may be linked to growth\r\nperformance improvements of broilers fed with OLE in\r\ndrinking water (10mL/L) (Jabri et al. 2017). Furthermore,\r\nthe enhanced performance rate of rabbits given olive leaves extract might be attributable to the antioxidant,\r\nantibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral\r\ncharacteristics of olive leaves extract (Aliabadi et al. 2012).\r\nAccording to Shafey et al. (2013), adding olive leaves\r\nextract (0, 1.8, 3.6, and 6.25g/kg) to broiler diets had no\r\neffect on feed consumption. According to Bahsi et al.\r\n(2016), adding 400 ppm of oleuropein to Japanese quail\r\nmeal boosted feed conversion ratio considerably. Ahmed et\r\nal. (2017) found that feeding laying hens 50, 100, or 150mg\r\nof oleuropein/kg diet enhanced egg production, egg mass,\r\nand feed conversion ratio considerably. Héla et al. (2019)\r\nfound that adding olive leaves aqueous extract to the\r\ndrinking water of developing rabbits at a concentration of\r\n20ml/L boosted daily body weight growth and feed\r\nconversion ratio linearly (P<0.05). The inclusion of 750\r\nppm of an olive pomace extract containing 10% total\r\ntriterpenes and 2% polyphenols considerably increased\r\nbroiler chick development performance (Herrero-Encinas\r\net al 2020). When OLE (75, 150, 300 and 600mg/kg) was\r\nadded to broiler chicken diets, body weight gain, carcass\r\nweight, and feed conversion ratio were improved (P<0.05)\r\nlinearly (Erener et al. 2020). The results of current study\r\nfound that enhanced growth performance in rabbits given\r\nOLE or OPE might be linked to FCR, digestive enzyme\r\nactivity, and nutrient absorption improvement, as well as\r\ncontrolling the gut microbiota, these findings also agreed\r\nwith the findings of Zeng et al. (2015).\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nThe inclusion of OLE2 and OPE2 resulted in the\r\ngreatest improvement in TDN, DCP, and DE percent. In\r\nterms of TDN, DCP, and DE percent, there were no\r\nsignificance differences between OLE1 and control.\r\nBroiler diets which contain olive leaves extracts, enhancing growth performance and feed efficiency due to the\r\nimprovement in nutritional digestibility, digestive enzyme\r\nactivation, and intestinal morphology (Leskovec et al.\r\n2018). This improvement might be attributed to a decrease\r\nin digesta viscosity, which boosts nutrient and enzyme\r\ndiffusion rates, allowing the animal to digest and absorb\r\nmore nutrients, resulting in improved intestinal health\r\n(Morrison et al. 2017). Furthermore, phenolic compounds\r\nin olive leaves can act as antioxidants and antibacterial,\r\nresulting in the growth of beneficial microflora and the\r\ndegradation of harmful or pathogenic microflora in the\r\ndigestive tract and caecum, resulting in improved nutrient\r\ndigestibility (Korukluoglu et al. 2010; Hamad 2015; Sarica\r\nand Ürkmez 2016; Thielmann et al. 2017; Elsherif et al. 2021).', 'These results suggested that including 200 and\r\n400ppm of olive leaves or olive pomace extracts into the\r\ndiet of growing rabbits might increase growth, carcass\r\ncharacteristics, antioxidant status, and economic efficiency\r\nwithout any negative effect on their health', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'Abaza L, Taamalli A, Nsir H and Zarrouk M, 2015.

Metabolic disorders occur when the body\'s normal metabolic process is disrupted by abnormal chemical reactions. It can also be characterized as a hereditary single gene aberration, the majority of which are autosomal recessive (Zheng et al. 2021). Physical inactivity, cigarette smoking and an elevated BMI are all\r\nlifestyle risk factors. Other causes include hypertension, poor glucose metabolism and high blood pressure and\r\ncholesterol concentration contribute to these disorders (Akhuemonkhan and Lazo 2017). Lethargy, weight loss, jaundice, and seizures are some of the signs of metabolic diseases. Symptoms would differ depending on the type of metabolic disease. Acute symptoms, late-onset acute\r\nsymptoms, gradual general symptoms, and persistent symptoms are the four types of symptoms (Agana et al. 2018; Mendrick et al. 2018). Inherited metabolic diseases\r\nare a type of metabolic disorder caused by a faulty gene that results in an enzyme deficit. Inborn errors of metabolism are a group of disorders with a variety of subtypes. When the liver or pancreas does not function properly, metabolic disorders might develop. Fig. 1 represented some types of metabolic disorders (Hernández-Granados et al. 2018). Any sickness or disorder that affects the human reproductive system is referred to as reproductive disorders.\r\nImproper hormone yielding via ovaries or testes, as well as other endocrine glands is among them . Genetic or congenital\r\ndefects, infections, tumors, or disorders of unknown sources can all cause these diseases (Hutson et al. 2014) .\r\nGenetic abnormalities, genital anomalies, infections,\r\nstructural differences, and cancers are the primary divisions of these disorders (Rawal and Austin 2015; Elshazly et al.\r\n2019). Symptoms of reproductive disorders are bleeding in between periods and within it, itching, burning of the\r\ngenital area, and pain during sex, severe pelvic/abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination (Hutson et\r\nal. 2014). Common reproductive conditions for human females are anomalies of the clitoris, vagina and uterus,\r\nabnormalities of menstrual cycle endometriosis, cancers, polycystic ovarian syndrome and diseases as AIDS,\r\nsyphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and genital herpes. And in men are pseudo hermaphroditism, anomalies of the penis,\r\nurethra, testes, prostate gland and seminal vesicles, Impotence, benign prostatic hyperplasia, Priapism,\r\ntesticular cancer and prostate disease. Intersexuality syndrome as Klinefelter, Turner, and testicular feminization. Delayed and precocious puberty in both\r\n(Rawal and Austin 2015). Infertility is one of the most serious issues that is worsening by the day and endangering\r\nthe human generation\'s future. Varicocele reduces sperm morphology and improves sperm count in people with aberrant morphology. Ovarian, cervical and prostate cancers are the deadliest of reproductive cancers. Some risk\r\nfactors for this malignancy include age, history of family and late menopause. While pregnant and breastfeeding, the\r\nlikelihood of occurrence is reduced (Salehi et al. 2008). There is a relation between metabolic and reproductive\r\ndisorders as diabetic complications can lead to some reproductive disorder as subfertility, delayed puberty or\r\ndisturbance in the menstrual cycle. Reproductive difficulties can appear early in adolescence, later, or during\r\nthe climacteric period, relying on the age at which diabetes is discovered. Decreased concentrations of LH, FSH and\r\nestradiol occurred in type 2 human studies (Gnanadass et al. 2021).\r\nBecause of central hypogonadism, women with type 1 diabetes sometimes have amenorrhoea, polycystic ovarian\r\nsyndrome and hyperandrogenism, and infertility that can be controlled by insulin administration and improved\r\nmetabolic disorder (Codner et al. 2012). Also, type 2 diabetes is related to other reproductive disorders like obesity and insulin resistance related to polycystic ovarian syndrome due to improper lifestyle. Although pubertal breast development appears to be delayed in type 1 diabetes, some people with type 1 diabetes still experience a small delay in menarche due to diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy (Calcaterra et al. 2021). The most common menstrual cycle abnormalities are oligomenorrhoea and\r\nprolonged cycle length that are related to patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes, studies revealed that these disturbances\r\nare more than six times than normal women without diabetes. Disturbance in BMI, sex steroid and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations is also related to\r\ntype 2 diabetes (Thong et al. 2021).', 'Study Ethical Approval\r\nThe authors confirm that the ethical policies of the\r\njournal have been adhered to and the appropriate ethical\r\nreview committee approval has been received. The authors\r\nfollowed EU standards for the protection of animals used\r\nfor scientific purposes. The experimental work was\r\nconducted at Sakha Research Station in Kafrelsheikh\r\nGovernorate, Animal Production Research Institute,\r\nAgricultural Research Center, the Ministry of Agriculture,\r\nEgypt. The laboratory part conducted at laboratories of\r\nNational Research Centre, Animal Production Department,\r\nEgypt, and By-Products Research Department, Animal\r\nProduction Research Institute, Agricultural Research\r\nCenter, Egypt.\r\nExtracts of Olive Leaves and Olive Pomace\r\nOlive leaves and pomace were extracted using 65\r\npercent ethanol with vigorous stirring for three hours\r\nadopting a heat reflux extraction procedure. The extract\r\nwas then separated at 40°C using a rotary evaporator\r\n(Loghmanifar et al. 2020; Elsherif et al. 2021). Finally,\r\nCalcium carbonate was added as a carrier material to load\r\nthe extracts separately, giving them the ability to use and\r\nmix with feed ingredients.\r\nExperimental Diets\r\nAccording to Agriculture Ministry Decree, 1996\r\nrequirements, the control diet was formed to meet all the\r\nnutritional needs of growing rabbits. Control (without\r\nadditives), OLE1 (Olive leaves extract, 200ppm), OLE2\r\n(olive leaves extract, 400ppm), OPE1 (olive pomace\r\nextract, 200ppm) and OPE2 (olive pomace extract,\r\n400ppm) were the five treatments. The experiment lasted\r\n56 days (from 42-98 days of age). Table 1 shows the\r\ncomposition of the control diet as well as the computed\r\nanalyses.\r\nAnimals and Management\r\nSeventy-five APRI growing rabbits were divided into\r\nfive groups of 15 rabbits each at 42 days of age (624g\r\naverage body weight). Rabbits were kept in battery cages\r\nwith separate feeding units. Water and diets were available\r\nad libitum. All the rabbits were kept in the same sanitary\r\nand managerial settings. Weekly feed intake and live body\r\nweight were recorded and the feed efficiency and body\r\nweight gained were computed.\r\nDigestibility Trail\r\nAt the end of this experiment, seven rabbits from each\r\ngroup were used in a digestibility test. Feces were collected\r\ndaily, weighed, dried at 60°C for 24 hours, roughly\r\npowdered, and stored for AOAC, 2000 chemical analysis.\r\nAccording to Pérez et al. (1995), the coefficients of\r\ndigestion and nutritional values of the dietary treatments\r\nwere calculated using data from amounts and chemical\r\nanalyses of feed and feces.\r\nCarcass Characteristics and Blood Samples\r\nFive rabbits from each treatment were starved for 24\r\nhours and slaughtered for carcass and internal organs at the\r\nend of the experiment. The percentages of carcass and\r\norgans as a percentage of live weights were calculated.\r\nBlood samples were taken from the slaughtered rabbits as\r\nwell.\r\nAnalyses of Antioxidants Status\r\nBlood serum samples were separated by centrifugation\r\nat 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, then stored at -20°C until\r\nchemical analysis. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and\r\nmalondialdehyde (MDA) levels in blood serum were\r\nexamined. The livers were also obtained for the\r\nmeasurement of hepatic CAT, SOD, and GSH antioxidant\r\nenzymes in an automated calibration spectrophotometer\r\nwith high-performance readings (bio diagnostic, Cairo,\r\nEgypt) (FlexorEL200 Biochemical Analyzer).\r\nThyroid Hormone Concentration\r\nTotal T3 and T4 levels in the blood were measured\r\nusing commercial ELISA kits (MyBioSource, Inc., San\r\nDiego, CA). By dividing the T3 value by the T4 value, the\r\nT3/T4 ratio was computed.\r\nCecum pH, Ammonia Nitrogen Concentration and\r\nTotal Volatile Fatty Acids\r\nCecum contents samples were taken from slaughtered\r\nrabbits and utilized to measure cecum pH using a digital pH\r\nmeter immediately. Conway (1958) technique was used to\r\ndetermine the ammonia nitrogen concentration. According\r\nto Eadie et al. (1967), the total volatile fatty acids in caecum were determined using steam distillation unit.\r\nEconomic Efficiency At the end of the trial period, the economic efficiency profit of rabbit production were calculated using the following formula:\r\n➢ (Total feed cost + additives cost) Equals total cost per rabbit.\r\n➢ (Body weight gain (kg) x selling price of kg rabbit) Equals total return per rabbit (Egyptian pound, L.E).\r\n➢ Total return per rabbit - total cost per rabbit equals net return per rabbit (L.E.).\r\n➢ Net return per rabbit divided by total cost per rabbit equals economic efficiency (L.E.).\r\n➢ Economic efficiency of each treatment calculated for each one with multiplying by 100 (control economic efficiency).\r\n\r\n', 'Performance Parameters\r\nTable 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on body weight (bwt), weight gain (WG), feed\r\nintake (FI), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in growing\r\nrabbits. The results revealed that adding 200ppm (OLE1,\r\nOPE1) or 400ppm (OLE2, OPE2) of olive leaves extract or\r\nolive pomace extract raised the final bwt linearly (P<0.05).\r\nIn comparison to the control diet, which had a final body\r\nweight of 2011g, OPE1 had the highest value (2175g).\r\nThere were no significant variations in bwt between the\r\ngroups given OLE or OPE at the two levels tested. The\r\naddition of OLE or OPE greatly improved WG at all ages,\r\nand the results of WG followed the same trend as bwt. OPE\r\nhad a better effect on WG than OLE, although there were\r\nno significant differences between them. The feed intake of\r\nrabbits fed varied amounts of OLE or OPE in their diets\r\nwas unaffected linearly (P<0.05). In terms of FCR, adding\r\nOLE or OPE to growing rabbit diets enhanced FCR linearly\r\n(P<0.05) during the period of the trial compared to the\r\ncontrol group. The addition of OPE improved FCR more\r\nthan the addition of OLE. At the overall ages of the rabbits,\r\nthe results of the performance index (PI percent) and\r\nrelative growth rate (RGR percent) demonstrated\r\nsignificant (P<0.05) differences across the dietary\r\ntreatments. In comparison to the control, adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the rabbits\' diets enhanced PI and RGR\r\nconsiderably. The rabbits fed on OPE1-enriched diet had\r\nthe highest PI and RGR with values 69.31 and 113.12,\r\nrespectively. In terms of PI and RGR, there were no\r\nsignificant changes between OLE and OPE.\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nTable 3 shows the effect of olive leaves and pomace\r\nextracts on the digestibility coefficients and nutritional\r\nvalues of growing rabbits. The addition of OLE or OPE had\r\nno effect on the digestibility coefficients of CF, EE, or\r\nNFE. The addition of OLE or OPE raised the digestibility\r\ncoefficient of CP substantially (P<0.05). The groups fed\r\nOLE2 and OPE2 had the best digestibility coefficients for\r\nDM, OM and CP. When compared to the control, the\r\naddition of OLE or OPE significantly (P<0.05) enhanced\r\ntotal digestible nutrients (TDN), digestible energy (DE),\r\nand digestible crude protein (DCP).\r\nCarcass Characteristics\r\nTable 4 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\ncarcass traits. The addition of OLE or OLP enhanced\r\nsignificantly (P<0.05) carcass percent. The groups\r\nsupplemented with OLE2 or OPE2 had the highest carcass\r\npercent. The proportion of live body weight of the liver,\r\nheart, kidney, giblets, and spleen did not change because of\r\nthe varied additions. The control group had the greatest\r\nGIT percent, and dietary treatments supplementation with\r\ndifferent levels of extracts significantly (P<0.05) reduced\r\nGIT weight as a proportion of live body weight.\r\nAntioxidant Status\r\nTable 5 shows the effects of dietary treatments on\r\nrabbit antioxidant enzymes. When compared to the control\r\ngroup, the addition of olive leaves extract or olive pomace\r\nextract at 200 and 400ppm significantly improved total\r\nantioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD),\r\nand catalase (CAT). MDA, on the other hand, was\r\nconsiderably (P<0.05) reduced when OLE or OPE were\r\nadded.\r\nThyroid Hormones\r\nThe results of thyroid hormones were found in\r\ngrowing rabbits, as shown in Fig. 1. The addition of olive\r\nleaves extract or olive pomace extract to growing rabbit\r\ndiets at 200 or 400 ppm had no effect on T3, T4, or T4/T3\r\nin any of the groups.\r\nCaecum Fermentation Activities\r\nFig. 2 shows the effects of olive leaves and olive\r\npomace extracts on caecum total volatile fatty acids\r\n(TVFAs), ammonia nitrogen and pH. The addition of OLE\r\nor OPE had a significant (P<0.05) influence on caecum\r\nTVFAs and ammonia concentrations. The TVFA values for\r\nthe treatment groups varied from 4.16 to 4.14 (ml\r\neq/100mL) compared to 3.85 for the control group.\r\nTreatment ammonia concentrations were from 8.49 to 8.32\r\nmg/100mL, compared to 9.76mg/100 ml for the control.\r\nThe pH levels were unaffected and varied from 5.80 to 5.57\r\nfor the treatment groups compared to 5.97 for the control\r\ngroup.\r\nEconomic Efficiency\r\nTable 6 shows the impact of dietary treatments on\r\neconomic efficiency (EE) and relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE). The results showed that adding OLE or\r\nOPE to the diet of rabbits improved their relative economic\r\nefficiency (REE) compared to the control group. When\r\ncompared to the control diet, REE levels increased by\r\n13.56 and 18.64 percent with OLE1 and OLE2, and by\r\n25.42 and 19.49 percent with OPE1 and OPE2 for rabbit\r\ndiets, respectively.', 'Performance Parameters\r\nResults finding are confirmed by Oke et al. (2017),\r\nwho detected that supplementing olive leaves extract in the\r\ndrinking water of broiler chicks enhanced final body\r\nweight, weight gain, and feed conversion ratio linearly\r\n(P<0.05). The induction of antimicrobial activity with olive\r\nleaves extract components may be linked to growth\r\nperformance improvements of broilers fed with OLE in\r\ndrinking water (10mL/L) (Jabri et al. 2017). Furthermore,\r\nthe enhanced performance rate of rabbits given olive leaves extract might be attributable to the antioxidant,\r\nantibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral\r\ncharacteristics of olive leaves extract (Aliabadi et al. 2012).\r\nAccording to Shafey et al. (2013), adding olive leaves\r\nextract (0, 1.8, 3.6, and 6.25g/kg) to broiler diets had no\r\neffect on feed consumption. According to Bahsi et al.\r\n(2016), adding 400 ppm of oleuropein to Japanese quail\r\nmeal boosted feed conversion ratio considerably. Ahmed et\r\nal. (2017) found that feeding laying hens 50, 100, or 150mg\r\nof oleuropein/kg diet enhanced egg production, egg mass,\r\nand feed conversion ratio considerably. Héla et al. (2019)\r\nfound that adding olive leaves aqueous extract to the\r\ndrinking water of developing rabbits at a concentration of\r\n20ml/L boosted daily body weight growth and feed\r\nconversion ratio linearly (P<0.05). The inclusion of 750\r\nppm of an olive pomace extract containing 10% total\r\ntriterpenes and 2% polyphenols considerably increased\r\nbroiler chick development performance (Herrero-Encinas\r\net al 2020). When OLE (75, 150, 300 and 600mg/kg) was\r\nadded to broiler chicken diets, body weight gain, carcass\r\nweight, and feed conversion ratio were improved (P<0.05)\r\nlinearly (Erener et al. 2020). The results of current study\r\nfound that enhanced growth performance in rabbits given\r\nOLE or OPE might be linked to FCR, digestive enzyme\r\nactivity, and nutrient absorption improvement, as well as\r\ncontrolling the gut microbiota, these findings also agreed\r\nwith the findings of Zeng et al. (2015).\r\nDigestibility Coefficients and Nutritive Values\r\nThe inclusion of OLE2 and OPE2 resulted in the\r\ngreatest improvement in TDN, DCP, and DE percent. In\r\nterms of TDN, DCP, and DE percent, there were no\r\nsignificance differences between OLE1 and control.\r\nBroiler diets which contain olive leaves extracts, enhancing growth performance and feed efficiency due to the\r\nimprovement in nutritional digestibility, digestive enzyme\r\nactivation, and intestinal morphology (Leskovec et al.\r\n2018). This improvement might be attributed to a decrease\r\nin digesta viscosity, which boosts nutrient and enzyme\r\ndiffusion rates, allowing the animal to digest and absorb\r\nmore nutrients, resulting in improved intestinal health\r\n(Morrison et al. 2017). Furthermore, phenolic compounds\r\nin olive leaves can act as antioxidants and antibacterial,\r\nresulting in the growth of beneficial microflora and the\r\ndegradation of harmful or pathogenic microflora in the\r\ndigestive tract and caecum, resulting in improved nutrient\r\ndigestibility (Korukluoglu et al. 2010; Hamad 2015; Sarica\r\nand Ürkmez 2016; Thielmann et al. 2017; Elsherif et al. 2021).', 'These results suggested that including 200 and\r\n400ppm of olive leaves or olive pomace extracts into the\r\ndiet of growing rabbits might increase growth, carcass\r\ncharacteristics, antioxidant status, and economic efficiency\r\nwithout any negative effect on their health', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'All authors contributed equally to study design\r\nmethodology, interpretation of results, and writing of the\r\nmanuscript.', 'Abaza L, Taamalli A, Nsir H and Zarrouk M, 2015.

Moreover, social stigma against the use of antibiotics is also there. As, the welfare of animals, the environment, food safety and hygiene are also important factors. Something is needed that would meet all these stigmas and still be able to provide the best growth, immunity against diseases, peak production, disease treatment and reduce economic pressure. In the recent era, the use of biological products to replace synthetic products is highly recommended i.e., probiotics. Probiotics provide all the necessary activity needed to enhance the production and performance of poultry. Moreover, probiotics meet all the food safety and eco-friendly parameters. Probiotics enhance the gut flora, improve immunity, increase the activity of digestive enzymes by decreasing the production of ammonia, bind with enterotoxins & neutralizing them and as a result improve feed intake which directly affects the performance and production of the poultry.

The introduction of the probiotic “StimixZoostim” into the diets of the diary period in the amount of 10 ml per head at the age of 10-20 days, 15 ml – at the age of 21-90 days, contributes to the increase in the number of lactobacilli by 27.0%, bifidobacterium by 37.6%, with a decrease in the number of echerichia by 31.3%, compared with the first control group.
